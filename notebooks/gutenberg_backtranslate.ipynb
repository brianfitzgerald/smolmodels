       "Write a paragraph in a formal, literary style with a serious and slightly somber tone. The scene should involve a character responding to a question about their actions in a moment of urgency. Describe a situation where the character aids someone who is severely injured, emphasizing the gravity of the injury and the care taken to treat it. Use descriptive language to convey the injured personâ€™s condition, such as paleness and loss of blood, and detail the steps taken to address the wound, including cleaning and applying a medicinal substance. Maintain a narrative flow that balances action with reflection, using moderately complex sentences to create a sense of thoughtfulness and deliberation. Avoid overly modern or casual vocabulary, opting instead for words that evoke a historical or timeless setting. The paragraph should be concise but rich in detail, capturing the urgency and care of the moment without explicitly stating emotional reactions. Aim for a length of 3-4 sentences, ensuring each sentence contributes to the overall tone and progression of the scene."

       "The storm which had risen as night closed in swept over the isthmus.  The\n",
       "waves in its lakes dashed high, and the Red Sea, which thrust a bay\n",
       "shaped like the horn of a snail into it from the south, was lashed to the\n",

       "South, the strongest fort of the Etham line, had encamped a short time\n",
       "before, the sand lashed by the storm whirled through the air and, in the\n",
       "quarter occupied by the king and his great officials, hammers were\n",
       "constantly busy driving the tent-pins deeper into the earth; for the\n",

       "Black clouds hung in the north, but the moon and stars were often\n",
       "visible, and flashes of distant lightning frequently brightened the\n",
       "horizon.  Even now the moisture of heaven seemed to avoid this rainless\n",

       "three hours after sunset, a slender figure, scarcely beyond boyhood,\n",
       "approached the guards with a firm step and, showing a messenger's pass,\n",
       "asked the way to Prince Siptah's tent.\n",
       "\n",
       "He seemed to have had a toilsome journey; for his thick black locks were\n",
       "tangled and his feet were covered with dust and dried clay.  Yet he\n",
       "excited no suspicion; for his bearing was that of a self-reliant freeman,\n",
       "his messenger's pass was perfectly correct, and the letter he produced\n",
       "was really directed to Prince Siptah; a scribe of the corn storehouses,\n",
       "who was sitting at the nearest fire with other officials and subordinate\n",
       "officers, examined it.\n",
       "\n",
       "As the youth's appearance pleased most of those present, and he came from\n",
       "Tanis and perhaps brought news, a seat at the fire and a share in the\n",

       "\n",
       "Declining the invitation with thanks, he answered the questions curtly\n",
       "and hurriedly and begged the resting soldiers for a guide.  One was\n",
       "placed at his disposal without delay.  But he was soon to learn that it\n",
       "would not be an easy matter to reach a member of the royal family; for\n",
       "the tents of Pharaoh, his relatives, and dignitaries stood in a special\n",
       "spot in the heart of the camp, hedged in by the shields of the heavily-\n",
       "armed troops.\n",
       "\n",
       "When he entered he was challenged again and again, and his messenger's\n",
       "pass and the prince's letter were frequently inspected.  The guide, too,\n",
       "was sent back, and his place was filled by an aristocratic lord, called I\n",
       "the 'eye and ear of the king,' who busied himself with the seal of the\n",
       "letter.  But the messenger resolutely demanded it, and as soon as it was\n",
       "again in his hand, and two tents standing side by side rocking in the\n",
       "tempest had been pointed out to him, one as Prince Siptah's, the other as\n",
       "the shelter of Masana, the daughter of Hornecht, for whom he asked, he\n",
       "turned to the chamberlain who came out of the former one, showed him the\n",
       "letter, and asked to be taken to the prince; but the former offered to\n",
       "deliver the letter to his master--whose steward he was--and Ephraim--for\n",
       "he was the messenger--agreed, if he would obtain him immediate admission\n",
       "to the young widow.\n",
       "\n",
       "The steward seemed to lay much stress upon getting possession of the\n",
       "letter and, after scanning Ephraim from top to toe, he asked if Kasana\n",
       "knew him, and when the other assented, adding that he brought her a\n",
       "verbal message, the Egyptian said smiling:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well then; but we must protect our carpets from such feet, and you seem\n",
       "weary and in need of refreshment.  Follow me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "With these words he took him to a small tent, before which an old slave\n",
       "and one scarcely beyond childhood were sitting by the fire, finishing\n",
       "their late meal with a bunch of garlic.\n",
       "\n",
       "They started up as they saw their master; but he ordered the old man to\n",
       "wash the messenger's feet, and bade the younger ask the prince's cook in\n",
       "his name for meat, bread, and wine.  Then he led Ephraim to his tent,\n",
       "which was lighted by a lantern, and asked how he, who from his appearance\n",
       "was neither a slave nor a person of mean degree, had come into such a\n",
       "pitiable plight.  The messenger replied that on his way he had bandaged\n",
       "the wounds of a severely injured man with the upper part of his apron,\n",
       "and the chamberlain instantly went to his baggage and gave him a piece of\n",
       "finely plaited linen.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ephraim's reply, which was really very near the truth, had cost him so\n",
       "little thought and sounded so sincere, that it won credence, and the\n",
       "steward's kindness seemed to him so worthy of gratitude that he made no\n",
       "objection when the courtier, without injuring the seal, pressed the roll\n",
       "of papyrus with a skilful hand, separating the layers and peering into\n",
       "the openings to decipher the contents.  While thus engaged, the corpulent\n",
       "courtier's round eyes sparkled brightly and it seemed to the youth as if\n",
       "the countenance of the man, whose comfortable plumpness and smooth\n",
       "rotundity at first appeared like a mirror of the utmost kindness of\n",
       "heart, now had the semblance of a cat's.\n",
       "\n",
       "As soon as the steward had completed his task, he begged the youth to\n",
       "refresh himself in all comfort, and did not return until Ephraim had\n",
       "bathed, wrapped a fresh linen upper-garment around his hips, perfumed and\n",
       "anointed his hair, and, glancing into the mirror, was in the act of\n",
       "slipping a broad gold circlet upon his arm.\n",
       "\n",
       "He had hesitated some time ere doing this; for he was aware that he would\n",
       "encounter great perils; but this circlet was his one costly possession\n",
       "and, during his captivity, it had been very difficult for him to hide it\n",
       "under his apron.  It might be of much service to him but, if he put it\n",
       "on, it would attract attention and increase the danger of being\n",
       "recognized.\n",
       "\n",
       "Yet the reflection he beheld in the mirror, vanity, and the desire\n",
       "to appear well in Kasana's eyes, conquered caution and prudent\n",
       "consideration, and the broad costly ornament soon glittered on his arm.\n",
       "\n",
       "The steward stood in astonishment before the handsome, aristocratic\n",
       "youth, so haughty in his bearing, who had taken the place of the\n",
       "unassuming messenger.  The question whether he was a relative of Kasana\n",
       "sprang to his lips, and receiving an answer in the negative, he asked to\n",
       "what family he belonged.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ephraim bent his eyes on the ground for some time in embarrassment, and\n",
       "then requested the Egyptian to spare him an answer until he had talked\n",
       "with Hornecht's daughter.\n",
       "\n",
       "The other, shaking his head, looked at him again, but pressed him no\n",
       "farther; for what he had read in the letter was a secret which might\n",
       "bring death to whoever was privy to it, and the aristocratic young\n",
       "messenger was doubtless the son of a dignitary who belonged to the circle\n",
       "of the fellow-conspirators of Prince Siptah, his master.\n",
       "\n",
       "A chill ran through the courtier's strong, corpulent body, and he gazed\n",
       "with mingled sympathy and dread at the blooming human flower associated\n",
       "thus early in plans fraught with danger.\n",
       "\n",
       "His master had hitherto only hinted at the secret, and it would still be\n",
       "possible for him to keep his own fate separate from his.  Should he do\n",
       "so, an old age free from care lay before him; but, if he joined the\n",
       "prince and his plan succeeded, how high he might rise!  Terribly\n",
       "momentous was the choice confronting him, the father of many children,\n",
       "and beads of perspiration stood on his brow as, incapable of any coherent\n",
       "thought, he led Ephraim to Kasana's tent, and then hastened to his\n",
       "master.\n",
       "\n",
       "Silence reigned within the light structure, which was composed of poles\n",
       "and gay heavy stuffs, tenanted by the beautiful widow.\n",
       "\n",
       "With a throbbing heart Ephraim approached the entrance, and when he at\n",
       "last summoned courage and drew aside the curtain fastened firmly to the\n",
       "earth, which the wind puffed out like a sail, he beheld a dark room, from\n",
       "which a similar one opened on the right and left.  The one on the left\n",
       "was as dark as the central one; but a flickering light stole through\n",
       "numerous chinks of the one on the right.  The tent was one of those with\n",
       "a flat roof, divided into three apartments, which he had often seen, and\n",
       "the woman who irresistibly attracted him was doubtless in the lighted\n",
       "one.\n",
       "\n",
       "To avoid exposing himself to fresh suspicion, he must conquer his timid\n",
       "delay, and he had already stooped and loosed the loop which fastened the\n",
       "curtain to the hook in the floor, when the door of the lighted room\n",
       "opened and a woman's figure entered the dark central chamber.\n",
       "\n",
       "Was it she?\n",
       "\n",
       "Should he venture to speak to her?  Yes, it must be done.\n",
       "\n",
       "Panting for breath and clenching his hands, he summoned up his courage as\n",
       "if he were about to steal unbidden into the most sacred sanctuary of a\n",
       "temple.  Then he pushed the curtain aside, and the woman whom he had just\n",
       "noticed greeted him with a low cry.\n",
       "\n",
       "But he speedily regained his composure, for a ray of light had fallen on\n",
       "her face, revealing that the person who stood before him was not Kasana,\n",
       "but her nurse, who had accompanied her to the prisoners and then to the\n",
       "camp.  She, too, recognized him and stared at him as though he had risen\n",
       "from the grave.\n",
       "\n",
       "They were old acquaintances; for when he was first brought to the\n",
       "archer's house she had prepared his bath and moistened his wound with\n",
       "balsam, and during his second stay beneath the same roof, she had joined\n",
       "her mistress in nursing him.  They had chatted away many an hour\n",
       "together, and he knew that she was kindly disposed toward him; for when\n",
       "midway between waking and sleeping, in his burning fever, her hand had\n",
       "stroked him with maternal tenderness, and afterwards she had never\n",
       "wearied of questioning him about his people and at last had acknowledged\n",
       "that she was descended from the Syrians, who were allied to the Hebrews.\n",
       "Nay, even his language was not wholly strange to her; for she had been a\n",
       "woman of twenty when dragged to Egypt with other prisoners of Rameses the\n",
       "Great.  Ephraim, she was fond of saying, reminded her of her own son when\n",
       "he was still younger.\n",
       "\n",
       "The youth had no ill to fear from her, so grasping her hand, he whispered\n",
       "that he had escaped from his guards and come to ask counsel from her\n",
       "mistress and herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "The word \"escaped\" was sufficient to satisfy the old woman; for her idea\n",
       "of ghosts was that they put others to flight, but did not fly themselves.\n",
       "Relieved, she stroked the youth's curls and, ere his whispered\n",
       "explanation was ended, turned her back upon him and hurried into the\n",
       "lighted room to tell her mistress whom she had found outside.\n",
       "\n",
       "A few minutes after Ephraim was standing before the woman who had become\n",
       "the guiding star of his life.  With glowing cheeks he gazed into the\n",
       "beautiful face, still flushed by weeping, and though it gave his heart a\n",
       "pang when, before vouchsafing him a greeting, she enquired whether Hosea\n",
       "had accompanied him, he forgot the foolish pain when he saw her gaze\n",
       "warmly at him.  Yet when the nurse asked whether she did not think he\n",
       "looked well and vigorous, and withal more manly in appearance, it seemed\n",
       "as though he had really grown taller, and his heart beat faster and\n",
       "faster.\n",
       "\n",
       "Kasana desired to learn the minutest details of his uncle's experiences;\n",
       "but after he had done her bidding and finally yielded to the wish to\n",
       "speak of his own fate, she interrupted him to consult the nurse\n",
       "concerning the means of saving him from unbidden looks and fresh\n",
       "dangers--and the right expedient was soon found.\n",
       "\n",
       "First, with Ephraim's help, the old woman closed the main entrance of the\n",
       "tent as firmly as possible, and then pointed to the dark room into which\n",
       "he must speedily and softly retire as soon as she beckoned to him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Meanwhile Kasana had poured some wine into a goblet, and when he came\n",
       "back with the nurse she made him sit down on the giraffe skin at her feet\n",
       "and asked how he had succeeded in evading the guards, and what he\n",
       "expected from the future.  She would tell him in advance that her father\n",
       "had remained in Tanis, so he need not fear recognition and betrayal.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her pleasure in this meeting was evident to both eyes and ears; nay,\n",
       "when Ephraim commenced his story by saying that Prince Siptah's command\n",
       "to remove the prisoners' chains, for which they were indebted solely to\n",
       "her, had rendered his escape possible, she clapped her hands like a\n",
       "child.  Then her face clouded and, with a deep sigh, she added that ere\n",
       "his arrival her heart had almost broken with grief and tears; but Hosea\n",
       "should learn what a woman would sacrifice for the most ardent desire of\n",
       "her heart.\n",
       "\n",
       "She repaid with grateful words Ephraim's assurance that, before his\n",
       "flight, he had offered to release his uncle from his bonds and, when she\n",
       "learned that Joshua had refused to accept his nephew's aid, lest it might\n",
       "endanger the success of the plan he had cleverly devised for him, she\n",
       "cried out to her nurse, with tearful eyes, that Hosea alone would have\n",
       "been capable of such a deed.\n",
       "\n",
       "To the remainder of the fugitive's tale she listened intently, often\n",
       "interrupting him with sympathizing questions.\n",
       "\n",
       "The torturing days and nights of the past, which had reached such a happy\n",
       "termination, seemed now like a blissful dream, a bewildering fairy-tale,\n",
       "and the goblet she constantly replenished was not needed to lend fire to\n",
       "his narrative.\n",
       "\n",
       "Never before had he been so eloquent as while describing how, in the\n",
       "ravine, he had stepped on some loose stones and rolled head foremost down\n",
       "into the chasm with them.  On reaching the bottom he had believed that\n",
       "all was lost; for soon after extricating himself from the rubbish that\n",
       "had buried him, in order to hurry to the pool, he had heard the whistle\n",
       "of the guards.\n",
       "\n",
       "Yet he had been a good runner from his childhood, had learned in his\n",
       "native pastures to guide himself by the light of the stars, so without\n",
       "glancing to the right or to the left, he had hastened southward as fast\n",
       "as his feet would carry him.  Often in the darkness he had fallen over\n",
       "stones or tripped in the hollows of the desert sand, but only to rise\n",
       "again quickly and dash onward, onward toward the south, where he knew he\n",
       "should find her, Kasana, her for whose sake he recklessly flung to the\n",
       "winds what wiser-heads had counselled, her for whom he was ready to\n",
       "sacrifice liberty and life.\n",
       "\n",
       "Whence he derived the courage to confess this, he knew not, and neither\n",
       "the blow from her fan, nor the warning exclamation of the nurse: \"Just\n",
       "look at the boy!\" sobered him.  Nay, his sparkling eyes sought hers still\n",
       "mote frequently as he continued his story.\n",
       "\n",
       "One of the hounds which attacked him he had flung against a rock, and the\n",
       "other he pelted with stones till it fled howling into a thicket.  He had\n",
       "seen no other pursuers, either that night, or during the whole of the\n",
       "next day.  At last he again reached a travelled road and found country\n",
       "people who told him which way Pharaoh's army had marched.  At noon,\n",
       "overwhelmed by fatigue, he had fallen asleep under the shade of a\n",
       "sycamore, and when he awoke the sun was near its setting.  He was very\n",
       "hungry, so he took a few turnips from a neighboring field.  But their\n",
       "owner suddenly sprang from a ditch near by, and he barely escaped his\n",
       "pursuit.\n",
       "\n",
       "He had wandered along during a part of the night, and then rested beside\n",
       "a well on the roadside, for he knew that wild beasts shun such frequented\n",
       "places.\n",
       "\n",
       "After sunrise he continued his march, following the road taken by the\n",
       "army.  Everywhere he found traces of it, and when, shortly before noon,\n",
       "exhausted and faint from hunger, he reached a village in the cornlands\n",
       "watered by the Seti-canal, he debated whether to sell his gold armlet,\n",
       "obtain more strengthening food, and receive some silver and copper in\n",
       "change.  But he was afraid of being taken for a thief and again\n",
       "imprisoned, for his apron had been tattered by the thorns, and his\n",
       "sandals had long since dropped from his feet.  He had believed that even\n",
       "the hardest hearts could not fail to pity his misery so, hard as it was\n",
       "for him, he had knocked at a peasant's door and begged.  But the man gave\n",
       "him nothing save the jeering counsel that a strong young fellow like him\n",
       "ought to use his arms and leave begging to the old and weak.  A second\n",
       "peasant had even threatened to beat him; but as he walked on with\n",
       "drooping bead, a young woman whom he had noticed in front of the\n",
       "barbarian's house followed him, thrust some bread and dates into his\n",
       "hand, and whispered hastily that heavy taxes had been levied on the\n",
       "village when Pharaoh marched through, or she would have given him\n",
       "something better.\n",
       "\n",
       "This unexpected donation, which he had eaten at the next well, had not\n",

       "youth of about his own age who, moaning with pain, held his foot clasped\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Apu, our nimble Nubian runner?\"  cried the young widow, and Ephraim\n",

       "a letter to Prince Siptah as quickly as possible, and the swift-footed\n",
       "lad, who was wont to outstrip his master's noble steeds, had shot over\n",
       "the road like an arrow and would have reached his destination in two\n",

       "\n",

       "the old nurse in the dark room.  There he perceived that a few moments'\n",

       "\n",
       "The village of Pihahiroth was soon gained, and while dashing by it\n",

       "pause even when a lofty palm, uprooted by the tempest, fell to the ground\n",

       "shepherds, was working his way with difficulty, but as rapidly as\n",
       "possible toward the camp.  He wore a mourning-robe, and while the others\n",
       "looked joyous and hopeful when they parted, his handsome face, framed by\n",

       "who now called himself Joshua, old Nun's impetuous spirit awoke and,\n",
       "clasping Ephraim closer to his heart, he cried out that though an old man\n",
       "he was not yet too aged to swing an axe and go with Ephraim's youthful\n",
       "band to liberate his son.  His eyes sparkled through his tears, and\n",

       "\n",
       "It was a touching entreaty, but so often interrupted by threats and\n",
       "curses that only a few could hear it.  Just as Ephraim and Miriam reached\n",
       "the shore she shrieked aloud--a rude hand had torn the gold serpent from\n",

       "sand-hill at whose foot the chariot had rested, and shouted with glowing\n",

       "\"Back!  Woe to any one who touches her!\"\n",

       "you.  If you thirst for more blood, come on; but I will keep the armlet.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "These words did not fail to produce their effect.  The furious women\n",
       "looked at the heavy broad gold armlet, then at the handsome youth, and\n",
       "the men of Judah and Ephraim who had gathered around him, and finally\n",
       "glanced enquiringly into one another's faces.  At last the wife of a\n",

       "\n",
       "The old chief had just been supplying weapons to the shepherds and youths\n",

       "She had never met him without gladdening him by a greeting which he\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "To find his darling in such a state caused the old man grief so profound\n",

       "\n",
       "After she had been laid on his couch, and Nun had placed his own chest of\n",
       "medicines at the disposal of the skilful prophetess, Miriam asked the men\n",
       "to leave her alone with the suffering Egyptian, and when she again called\n",
       "them into the tent she had revived the strength of the severely-wounded\n",

       "\n",
       "The old man and his grandson stood at the foot of her couch, and each\n",

       "\n",
       "The certainty that Kasana was wicked and faithless, which had so\n",

       "abandoned.  Yet what he had heard in her tent had remained a profound\n",
       "secret, and as he told his grandfather and Miriam that she had\n",
       "compassionately interceded for the prisoners, and both had desired to\n",
       "hear more of her, he had felt like a father who had witnessed the crime\n",
       "of a beloved son, and no word of the abominable things he had heard had\n",
       "escaped his lips.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now he rejoiced that he had kept silence; for whatever he might have seen\n",

       "\n",
       "To the old man she had never ceased to be the lovely child whom he had\n",
       "known, the apple of his eye and the joy of his heart.  So he gazed with\n",
       "tender anxiety at the features convulsed by pain and, when she at last\n",
       "opened her eyes, smiled at her with paternal affection.  Her glance\n",
       "showed that she instantly recognized both him and Ephraim, but weakness\n",
       "baffled her attempt to nod to them.  Yet her expressive face revealed\n",
       "surprise and joy, and when Miriam had given her the cordial a third time\n",
       "and bathed her brow with a powerful essence, her large eyes wandered from\n",
       "face to face and, noticing the troubled looks of the men, she managed to\n",
       "whisper:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The wound aches--and death--must I die?\"  One looked enquiringly at\n",
       "another, and the men would gladly have concealed the terrible truth; but\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh, let me know.  Ah, I pray you, tell me the truth!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Miriam, who was kneeling beside her, found courage to answer:\n",

       "can accomplish shall be done to preserve your life as long as possible.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The words sounded kind and full of compassion, yet the deep voice of the\n",
       "prophetess seemed to hurt Kasana; for her lips quivered painfully while\n",
       "Miriam was speaking, and when she ceased, her eyes closed and one large\n",
       "tear after another ran down her cheeks.  Deep, anxious silence reigned\n",
       "around her until she again raised her lashes and, fixing her eyes wearily\n",
       "on Miriam, asked softly, as if perplexed by some strange spectacle:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are a woman, and yet practise the art of the leech.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My God has commanded me to care for the suffering ones of our people,\"\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"You are Miriam, the woman who sent for Hosea.\"  And when the other\n",
       "answered promptly and proudly: \"It is as you say!\"  Kasana continued:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And you possess striking, imperious beauty, and much influence.  He\n",
       "obeyed your summons, and you--you consented to wed another?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Again the prophetess answered, this time with gloomy earnestness:  \"It is\n",
       "as you say.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The dying girl closed her eyes once more, and a strange proud smile\n",
       "hovered around her lips.  But it soon vanished and a great and painful\n",
       "restlessness seized upon her.  The fingers of her little hands, her lips,\n",
       "nay, even her eyelids moved perpetually, and her smooth, narrow forehead\n",
       "contracted as if some great thought occupied her mind.\n",
       "\n",
       "At last the ideas that troubled her found utterance and, as if roused\n",
       "from her repose, she exclaimed in terrified accents:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are Ephraim, who seemed like his son, and the old man is Nun, his\n",
       "dear father.  There you stand and will live on....  But I--I ....  Oh, it\n",
       "is so hard to leave the light....  Anubis will lead me before the\n",
       "judgment seat of Osiris.  My heart will be weighed, and then....\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Here she shuddered and opened and closed her trembling hands; but she\n",
       "soon regained her composure and began to speak again.  Miriam, however,\n",
       "sternly forbade this, because it would hasten her death.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then the sufferer, summoning all her strength, exclaimed hastily, as\n",
       "loudly as her voice would permit, after measuring the prophetess' tall\n",
       "figure with a long glance: \"You wish to prevent me from doing my duty--\n",
       "you?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "There had been a slight touch of mockery in the question; but Kasana\n",
       "doubtless felt that it was necessary to spare her strength; for she\n",
       "continued far more quietly, as though talking to herself:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I cannot die so, I cannot!  How it happened; why I sacrificed all,\n",
       "all....  I must atone for it; I will not complain, if he only learns how\n",
       "it came to pass.  Oh, Nun, dear old Nun, who gave me the lamb when I was\n",
       "a little thing--I loved it so dearly--and you, Ephraim, my dear boy, I\n",
       "will tell you everything.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Here a painful fit of coughing interrupted her; but as soon as she\n",
       "recovered her breath, she turned to Miriam, and called in a tone which\n",
       "so plainly expressed bitter dislike, that it would have surprised any\n",
       "one who knew her kindly nature:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But you, yonder,--you tall woman with the deep voice who are a\n",
       "physician, you lured him from Tanis, from his soldiers and from me.  He,\n",
       "he obeyed your summons.  And you .  .  .  .  you became another's wife;\n",
       "probably after his arrival ....  yes!  For when Ephraim summoned him, he\n",
       "called you a maiden .  .  .  I don't know whether this caused him, Hosea,\n",
       "pain ....  But there is one thing I do know, and that is that I want to\n",
       "confess something and must do so, ere it is too late....  And no one must\n",
       "hear it save those who love him, and I--do you hear--I love him, love him\n",
       "better than aught else on earth!  But you?  You have a husband, and a God\n",
       "whose commands you eagerly obey--you say so yourself.  What can Hosea be\n",
       "to you?  So I beseech you to leave us.  I have met few who repelled me,\n",
       "but you--your voice, your eyes--they pierce me to the heart--and if you\n",
       "were near I could not speak as I must....  and oh, talking hurts me so!\n",
       "But before you go--you are a leech--let me know this one thing--I have\n",
       "many messages to leave for him ere I die....  Will it kill me to talk?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Again the prophetess found no other words in answer except the brief:\n",

       "While wavering between the duty which, as a physician, she owed the\n",
       "sufferer and the impulse not to refuse the request of a dying woman, she\n",
       "read in old Nun's eyes an entreaty to obey Kasana's wish, and with\n",
       "drooping head left the tent.  But the bitter words of the hapless girl\n",
       "pursued her and spoiled the day which had begun so gloriously and also\n",
       "many a later hour; nay, to her life's end she could not understand why,\n",
       "in the presence of this poor, dying woman, she had been overpowered by\n",
       "the feeling that she was her inferior and must take a secondary place.\n",
       "\n",
       "As soon as Kasana was left alone with Nun and Ephraim, and the latter had\n",

       "She lay in this attitude so long that Nun feared death had claimed her\n",

       "When he finally spoke of the wife of the viceroy and chief-priest Bai,\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "The dying girl again smiled assent and softly exclaimed:\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh, all is well now, and if the gods grant him freedom....\"\n",

       "silently with a happy look.  By degrees, however, her smooth brow\n",
       "contracted in an anxious frown, and she gasped in low tones:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, all is well....  only one thing....  my body....  unembalmed....\n",

       "and, after a brief, painful convulsion, she sank back.  Death laid his\n",

The scene should depict a woman who, after a moment of deep contemplation, takes decisive action to arrange her departure. Begin with her catching her breath and gazing into the distance, then show her resolve as she instructs a servant to prepare a carriage for her journey. Include details about her pride and self-sufficiency, such as her decision to handle her own appearance. Mention a specific individual who has offered her the use of their carriage, and describe her sending a servant to request its loan. Add urgency by having her demand that the carriage be ready within a short timeframe, and include instructions for arranging horses and a courier. Use complex sentences with a mix of descriptive and imperative phrasing, and employ elevated vocabulary to convey the characterâ€™s status and determination. Aim for a paragraph of similar length and complexity to the original, ensuring it feels cohesive and period-appropriate."

       "On the way home Barbara often pressed her left hand with her right to\n",
       "assure herself that she was not dreaming.\n",
       "\n",
       "This time she found her husband in the house.  At the first glance\n",
       "Pyramus saw that something unusual had happened; but she gave him no time\n",
       "to question her, only glanced around to see if they were alone, and then\n",
       "cried, as if frantic: \"I will bear it no longer.  You must know it too.\n",
       "But it is a great secret.\"  Then she made him swear that he, too, would\n",
       "keep it strictly, and in great anxiety he obeyed.\n",
       "\n",
       "He, like Barbara's father, had supposed that the Emperor's son had\n",
       "entered the world only to leave it again.  Barbara's \"I no longer have a\n",
       "child; it was taken from me,\" he had interpreted in the same way as the\n",
       "old captain, and, from delicacy of feeling, had never again mentioned the\n",
       "subject in her presence.\n",
       "\n",
       "While taking the oath, he had been prepared for the worst; but when his\n",
       "wife, in passionate excitement, speaking so fast that the words fair\n",
       "tumbled over one another, told him how she had been robbed of her boy;\n",
       "how his imperial father had treated him; how she had longed for him;\n",
       "what prayers she had uttered in his behalf; how miserable she had been\n",
       "in her anxiety about this child; and, now, that Dona Magdalena's letter\n",
       "permitted her to cherish the highest and greatest hopes for the boy,\n",
       "the tall, strong man stood before her with downcast eyes, like a detected\n",
       "criminal, his hand gripping the edge of the top of the table which\n",
       "separated her from him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Barbara saw his broad, arched chest rise and fall, and wondered why his\n",
       "manly features were quivering; but ere she had time to utter a single\n",
       "soothing word, he burst forth: \"I made the vow and will be silent; but\n",
       "to-morrow, or in a year or two, it will be in everybody's mouth, and\n",
       "then, then  My good name!  Honour!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Fierce indignation overwhelmed Barbara, and, no longer able to control\n",
       "herself, she exclaimed: \"What did it matter whether Death or his father\n",
       "snatched the child from me?  The question is, whether you knew that I am\n",
       "his mother, and it was not concealed from you.  Nevertheless, you came\n",
       "and sought me for your wife!  That is what happened!  And--you know this\n",
       "--you are as much or little dishonoured by me, the mother of the living\n",
       "child, as of the dead one.  Out upon the honour which is harmed by\n",
       "gossip!  What slanderous tongues say of me as a disgrace I deem the\n",
       "highest honour; but if you are of a different opinion, and held it when\n",
       "you wooed me, you would be wiser to prate less loudly of the proud word\n",
       "'honour,' and we will separate.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Pyramus had listened to these accusations and the threat with trembling\n",
       "lips.  His simple but upright mind felt that she was right, so far as he\n",
       "was concerned, and she was more beautiful in her anger than he had seen\n",
       "her since the brilliant days of her youthful pride.  The fear of losing\n",
       "her seized his poor heart, so wholly subject to her, with sudden power\n",
       "and, stammering an entreaty for forgiveness, he confessed that the\n",
       "surprise had bewildered him, and that he thought he had showed in the\n",
       "course of the last ten years how highly, in spite of people's gossip,\n",
       "he prized her.  He held out his large honest hand with a pleading look\n",
       "as he spoke, and she placed hers in it for a short time.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then she went to church to collect her thoughts and relieve her\n",
       "overburdened heart.  Boundless contempt for the man to whom she was\n",
       "united filled it; yet she felt that she owed him a debt of gratitude,\n",
       "that he was weak only through love, and that, for her children's sake,\n",
       "she must continue to wear the yoke which she had taken upon herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "His existence henceforth became of less and less importance to her\n",
       "feelings and actions, especially as he left the management of their two\n",
       "boys to her.  He had reason to be satisfied with it, for she provided\n",
       "Conrad with the best instruction, that the might choose between the army\n",
       "and the legal profession; his younger brother she intended for the\n",
       "priesthood, and the boy's inclination harmonized with her choice.\n",
       "\n",
       "The fear that the Emperor Charles might yet commit the child she loved\n",
       "to the monastery never left her.  But she thought that she might induce\n",
       "Heaven to relinquish its claim upon her John, whom, moreover, it seemed\n",
       "to have destined for the secular life, by consecrating her youngest child\n",
       "to its service.\n",
       "\n",
       "While she did not forget her household, her mind was constantly in Spain.\n",
       "Her walks were usually directed toward the palace, to inquire how the\n",
       "recluse in San Yuste was faring, and whether any rumour mentioned her\n",
       "imperial son.\n",
       "\n",
       "After the great victory gained by Count Egmont against the military\n",
       "forces of France, eleven months after the battle of St. Quentin, there\n",
       "was enough to be seen in Brussels.  The successful general was greeted\n",
       "with enthusiastic devotion.  Egmont's name was in every one's mouth, and\n",
       "when she, too, saw the handsome, proud young hero, the idol, as it were,\n",
       "of a whole nation, gorgeous in velvet, silk, and glittering gems, curbing\n",
       "his fiery steed and bowing to the shouting populace with a winning smile,\n",
       "she thought she caught a glimpse of the future, and beheld the\n",
       "predecessor of him who some day would receive similar homage.\n",
       "\n",
       "Why should she not have yielded to such hopes?  Already there was a\n",
       "rumour that the daughter of the Emperor and that Johanna Van der Gheynst,\n",
       "who had been Charles's first love, Margaret of Parma, her own son's\n",
       "sister, had been chosen to rule the Netherlands as regent.\n",
       "\n",
       "Why should less honours await Charles's son than his daughter?\n",
       "\n",
       "But the festal joy in the gay capital was suddenly extinguished, for in\n",
       "the autumn of the year that, in March, had seen Ferdinand, the Emperor's\n",
       "brother, assume the imperial crown, a rumour came that the recluse of San\n",
       "Yuste had closed his eyes, and a few days after it was verified.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was Barbara's husband who told her of the loss which had befallen her\n",
       "and the world.  He did this with the utmost consideration, fearing the\n",
       "effect of this agitating news upon his wife; but Barbara only turned\n",
       "pale, and then, with tears glittering in her eyes, said softly, \"He, too,\n",
       "was only a mortal man.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Then she withdrew to her own room, and even on the following day saw\n",
       "neither her husband nor her children.  She had long expected Charles's\n",
       "death, yet it pierced the inmost depths of her being.\n",
       "\n",
       "This sorrow was something sacred, which belonged to her and to her alone.\n",
       "It would have seemed a profanation to reveal it to her unloved husband,\n",
       "and she found strength to shut it within herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "How desolate her heart seemed!  It had lost its most distinguished object\n",
       "of love or hate.\n",
       "\n",
       "Through long days she devoted herself in quiet seclusion to the memory of\n",
       "the dead, but soon her active imagination unfolded its wings again, and\n",
       "with the new grief mingled faint hopes for the boy in Spain, which\n",
       "increased to lofty anticipations and torturing anxiety.\n",
       "\n",
       "The imperial father was dead.  What now awaited the omnipotent ruler's\n",
       "son?\n",
       "\n",
       "How had Charles determined his fate?\n",
       "\n",
       "Was it possible that he still intended him for the monastic life, now\n",
       "that he had become acquainted with his talents and tastes?\n",
       "\n",
       "Since Barbara had learned that her son had won his father's heart, and\n",
       "that the Emperor, as it were, had made him his own with a kiss, she had\n",
       "grown confident in the hope that Charles would bestow upon him the\n",
       "grandeur, honours, and splendour which she had anticipated when she\n",
       "resigned him at Landshut, and to which his birth gave him a claim.\n",
       "But her early experience that what she expected with specially joyful\n",
       "security rarely happened,--constantly forced upon her mind the, fear that\n",
       "the dead man's will would consign John to the cloister.\n",
       "\n",
       "So the next weeks passed in a constant alternation of oppressive fears\n",
       "and aspiring hopes, the nights in torturing terrors.\n",
       "\n",
       "All the women of the upper classes wore mourning, and with double reason;\n",
       "for, soon after the news of the Emperor's death reached Brussels, King\n",
       "Philip's second wife, Mary Tudor, of England, also died.  Therefore no\n",
       "one noticed that Barbara wore widow's weeds, and she was glad that she\n",
       "could do so without wounding Pyramus.\n",
       "\n",
       "A part of the elaborate funeral rites which King Philip arranged in\n",
       "Brussels during the latter part of December in honour of his dead father\n",
       "was the procession which afforded the authorities of the Brabant capital\n",
       "an opportunity to display the inventive faculty, the love of splendour,\n",
       "the learning, and the wit which, as members of flourishing literary\n",
       "societies, they constantly exercised.  In the pageant was a ship with\n",
       "black sails, at whose keel, mast, and helm stood Hope with her anchor,\n",
       "Faith with her chalice, and Love with the burning heart.  Other similar\n",
       "scenic pieces made the sincerity of the grief for the dead questionable,\n",
       "and yet many real tears were shed for him.  True, the wind which swelled\n",
       "the sails of the sable ship bore also many an accusation and curse; among\n",
       "the spectators of the procession there were only too many whose mourning\n",
       "robes were worn not for the dead monarch, but their own nearest\n",
       "relatives, whom his pitiless edicts had given to the executioner\n",
       "as readers of the Bible or heterodox.\n",
       "\n",
       "These displays, so pleasing to the people of her time and her new home,\n",
       "were by no means great or magnificent enough for Barbara.  Even the most\n",
       "superb show seemed to her too trivial for this dead man.\n",
       "\n",
       "She was never absent from any mass for the repose of his soul, and she\n",
       "not only took part outwardly in the sacred ceremony, but followed it with\n",
       "fervent devotion.  As a transfigured spirit, he would perceive how she\n",
       "had once hated him; but he should also see how tenderly she still loved\n",
       "him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now that he was dead, it would be proved in what way he had remembered\n",
       "the son whom, in his solitude, he had learned to love, what life path\n",
       "John had been assigned by his father.\n",
       "\n",
       "But longingly as Barbara thought of Spain and of her boy, often as she\n",
       "went to the Dubois house and to the regent's home to obtain news, nothing\n",
       "could be heard of her child.\n",
       "\n",
       "Many provisions of the imperial will were known, but there was no\n",
       "mention of her son.  Yet Charles could not have forgotten him, and Adrian\n",
       "protested that it would soon appear that he had not omitted him in his\n",
       "last will, and this was done in a manner which indicated that he knew\n",
       "more than he would or could confess.\n",
       "\n",
       "All this increased Barbara's impatience to the highest degree, and\n",
       "induced her to watch and question with twofold zeal.  On no account would\n",
       "she have left the capital during this period of decision, and, though her\n",
       "husband earnestly entreated her to go to the springs, whose waters had\n",
       "proved so beneficial, she remained in Brussels.\n",
       "\n",
       "In August she saw King Philip set out for Spain, and Margaret of Parma,\n",
       "her son's sister, assume the government of the Netherlands as regent.\n",
       "\n",
       "On various occasions she succeeded in obtaining a near view of the\n",
       "stately-lady, with her clever; kindly and, spite of the famous down\n",
       "on her upper lip, by no means unlovely features, and her attractive\n",
       "appearance gave Barbara courage to request an audience, in order to learn\n",
       "from her something about her child.  But the effort was vain, for the\n",
       "duchess had had no news of the existence of a second son of her father;\n",
       "and this time it was Granvelle who prevented the regent from receiving\n",
       "the woman who would probably have spoken to her of the boy concerning\n",

       "in the arm-chair opposite to the young wife when, at her entreaty, he\n",
       "began to tell the story again.  She had informed him of Dona Magdalena's\n",

       "\n",
       "The account given in the letter written by Quijada's wife also applied to\n",
       "the last months of the imperial recluse's existence.  Doubtless he\n",
       "sometimes devoted himself to pious exercises and quiet meditation, but he\n",
       "was usually busied with political affairs and the reading and dictating\n",
       "of despatches.  Even at that time he received many visitors.  When\n",
       "Geronimo came from Cuacos, he was permitted to go in and out of his\n",

       "\n",
       "He was a boy who had well-formed, somewhat sickly features, and a fragile\n",
       "body.  Of course the grandfather felt the deepest interest in him, and\n",
       "the influence of the famous victor in so many battles upon the twelve-\n",

       "\n",
       "But Charles had scarcely left Valladolid when the passionate boy's\n",

       "tutor, and especially the young evildoer's aunt, Juana, the Emperor\n",
       "Charles's daughter, earnestly entreated him to let the grandson, whose\n",
       "presence would disturb him very little, come to San Yuste, because his\n",
       "influence over Don Carlos would be of priceless value, the grandfather\n",
       "most positively refused the request.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the other hand, the Emperor had not only tolerated his son Geronimo\n",
       "near him, but rejoiced in his presence, for the quiet sufferer's eyes had\n",
       "sparkled when he saw him.  Wolf himself had often witnessed this\n",
       "delightful sight.\n",
       "\n",
       "How Barbara's heart swelled, how eagerly she listened, as Wolf described\n",
       "how well founded was his Majesty's affection for this beautiful,\n",

       "\n",
       "True, he showed as yet little taste for knowledge and all that can be\n",
       "learned from books; but he devoted himself with fiery zeal to the\n",
       "knightly exercises which since his Majesty's death Quijada himself was\n",
       "directing, and in which he promised to become a master.  Besides, by\n",
       "appealing to his ambition, he could be induced to put forth all his\n",

       "\n",
       "He had not remained unnoticed by any of the great lords who had sought\n",

       "\n",
       "Even when Death was already stretching hi hand toward the Emperor, he was\n",
       "still overburdened with business, and the heretical agitation which was\n",

       "men and women whom he knew personally, belonging to the distinguished\n",
       "families of Posa and De Rojas, has taken part in it.\n",
       "\n",

       "Luther, the safe conduct promised.\n",
       "\n",
       "Before a fatal weakness suddenly attacked him his health had been rather\n",
       "better than before; then his voice failed, and Quijada was compelled to\n",
       "kneel beside his bed that he might understand what he wished to impress\n",
       "upon him.  While doing so, the dying man had expressed the desire that\n",
       "Don Luis would commend Geronimo to the love of his son Philip.\n",
       "\n",
       "He had also remembered the love of better days, and when Barbara insisted\n",

       "Luis, did not withhold it.\n",
       "\n",
       "He had complained of her perverse nature.  Had she obediently gone to the\n",
       "convent, he might have spared himself and her the sorrow of holding her\n",
       "so rigidly aloof from his person.  Finally, he had spoken of her singing\n",
       "with rapturous delight.  At night the \"Quia amore langueo\" from the Mary\n",
       "motet had echoed softly from his lips, and when he perceived that Don\n",
       "Luis had heard him, he murmured that this peerless cry of longing,\n",
       "reminded him not of the earthly but the heavenly love.\n",
       "\n",
       "At these words Barbara hid her face in her hands, and Wolf paused until\n",
       "she had controlled the sobs which shook her breast.\n",

       "The Archbishop of Toledo was summoned, and predicted that Charles would\n",

       "light of the world on St. Matthias's day.\n",
       "\n",
       "Charles's death-agony was severe.  When Dr. Mathys at last said softly to\n",
       "those who were present, \"Jam moritur,\"--[Now he is dying]--the loud cry\n",
       "\"Jesus!\" escaped his lips, and he sank back upon the pillows lifeless.\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "While she was wiping her eyes, Wolf described the great anxiety which,\n",
       "after Charles's death, overpowered the Quijadas in Villagarcia.\n",
       "\n",
       "The codicil had existed, and Don Luis was familiar with its contents.\n",

       "Dona Magdalena knew not what to do with herself in her anxiety.\n",
       "\n",
       "The immediate future must decide Geronimo's fate, so she went on a\n",
       "pilgrimage with her darling to the Madonna of Guadelupe to pray for the\n",
       "repose of the Emperor's soul, and also to beseech the gracious Virgin\n",
       "mercifully to remember him, Geronimo.\n",
       "\n",
       "Until that time the boy had believed Don Luis and his wife to be his\n",

       "\n",
       "He had not even the slightest suspicion that he was a child of the\n",
       "Emperor, and was perfectly satisfied with the lot of being the son of a\n",
       "grandee and the child of so good, tender, and beautiful a mother.\n",
       "\n",
       "This exciting expectation on the part of the Quijadas lasted nearly a\n",
       "whole year, for it was that length of time before Don Philip finally left\n",
       "the Netherlands and reached Valladolid.\n",
       "\n",
       "He spent the anniversary of his father's death in the monastery of Del\n",
       "Abrojo.\n",
       "\n",
       "There, or previously, he had read the codicil in which his imperial\n",
       "father acknowledged the boy Geronimo as his son.\n",
       "\n",
       "Barbara now desired to learn the contents of the codicil and, as Wolf had\n",
       "told her yesterday how the boy's fate had changed, he interrupted his\n",

       "\n",
       "As a widower, Charles confessed that he had had a son in Germany by an\n",
       "unmarried woman.  He had reason to wish that the boy should assume\n",
       "the robe of a reformed order, but he must be neither forced nor persuaded\n",
       "to do so.  If he wished to remain in the world, he would settle upon him\n",
       "a yearly income of from twenty to thirty thousand ducats, which was to\n",
       "pass also to his heirs.  Whatever mode of life he might choose, he\n",
       "commanded his son Philip to honour him and treat him with due respect.\n",
       "\n",
       "As on the day before, when Barbara had only learned in general terms\n",
       "what the codicil contained, her soul to-day, while listening to the\n",
       "more minute particulars, was filled with grateful joy.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her sacrifice had not been vain.  For years the fear of seeing her son\n",
       "vanish in a monastery had darkened her days and nights, and Quijada and\n",
       "Dona Magdalena had also probably dreaded that King Philip might confide\n",
       "his half-brother to a reformed order, for the monarch had by no means\n",
       "hastened to inform the anxious pair what he had determined.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was not until the end of September that, upon the pretext of hunting,\n",
       "he went to the monastery of San Pedro de la Espina, a league from\n",
       "Villagarcia, and ordered Don Luis to seek him there with the boy.\n",
       "He was to leave the latter wholly unembarrassed, and not even inform\n",

       "\n",
       "His decision, he had added in the chilling manner characteristic of him,\n",
       "would depend upon circumstances.\n",
       "\n",
       "Quijada, with a throbbing heart, obeyed, but Geronimo had no suspicion of\n",
       "what awaited him, and only wondered why his mother took so much trouble\n",
       "about his dress, since they were merely going hunting.  The tears\n",
       "glittering in her eyes he attributed to the anxiety which she often\n",
       "expressed when he rode with the hunters on the fiery young Andalusian\n",
       "which his father had given him.  He was then twelve years and a half old,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"To soothe her, I began to talk about the pieces of music which his\n",

       "declared that he liked to listen to her, though her voice still lacked\n",
       "much of the overpowering magic of former days.  She was in a position,\n",
       "too, to gratify many a taste for whose satisfaction she had often\n",
       "yearned, yet she could not attain a genuine and thorough new sense of\n",
       "happiness.\n",
       "\n",
       "The weeks which, a few years after her John's recognition, she spent with\n",
       "self-sacrificing devotion beside her husband's couch of pain, which was\n",
       "to become his deathbed, passed amid anxiety and grief, and when her\n",
       "affectionate, careful nursing proved vain, and Pyramus died, deep and\n",
       "sincere sorrow overpowered her.  True, he had not succeeded in winning\n",
       "her to return his tender love; but after he had closed his eyes she\n",
       "realized for the first time what a wealth of goodness and fidelity was\n",
       "buried with him and lost to her forever.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her youngest boy, soon after his father's death, was torn from her by\n",
       "falling into a cistern, and she yielded herself to such passionate grief\n",
       "for his loss that she thought she could never conquer it; but it was soon\n",
       "soothed by the belief that, for the sake of this devout child, whose\n",
       "training for a religious life had already commenced, Heaven had resigned\n",
       "its claims upon John, and that the boy was dwelling in the immediate\n",

       "departure--tidings closely associated with the sorrow inflicted through\n",
       "her John had saddened her.  The ship which was to bear the loyal\n",
       "companion of her youth to Spain was wrecked just before the end of the\n",
       "voyage, and Wolf went down with it.  Barbara learned the news only by\n",
       "accident, and his death first made her realize with full distinctness\n",
       "how dear he had been to her.\n",
       "\n",
       "The letter which she had addressed to her son was lost with the man in\n",
       "whom Fate had wrested from her the last friend who would have been able\n",

       "mother's real character.\n",
       "\n",
       "For two years she had hoped that Wolf would complete her letter in his\n",
       "own person, and tell her son how her voice and her beauty had won his\n",
       "father's heart.  Quijada had known it; but if he spoke of her to his wife\n",
       "and foster-son, it was scarcely in her favour--he cared little for music\n",

       "\n",
       "So the loss of this letter seemed to her, with reason, a severe\n",

       "the new letter, which began with thanks for the financial aid which the\n",
       "son had conferred upon his mother through his royal brother, was\n",
       "distasteful both to her pride and her maternal affection.  Half prosaic,\n",
       "half far too effusive, it gave a distorted idea of her real feelings, and\n",
       "she tore it up before giving it to the messenger.\n",
       "\n",
       "Yet she did not cease to hope that, in some favourable hour, the heart of\n",
       "the idol of her soul would urge him to approach his mother; but year\n",

       "\n",
       "She opened it curiously, and while reading it her cheeks paled and\n",
       "flushed as in the days of her youth.  Then it dropped into her lap, and\n",

       "travelling carriage.  The major-domo must go to him at once and say that\n",
       "Madame de Blomberg asks the loan of the vehicle.  Let the page Diego\n",
       "order post and courier horses at the same time.  The carriage must be\n",
       "ready in an hour.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But, Madame,\" cried the maid, raising her hands in alarm and admonition,\n",
       "\"the Rassinghams are expecting you.  The honour!  Every one who is well\n",
       "disposed in the States-General will be there.  Who knows what the party\n",

       "hear!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No matter,\" replied Barbara.  \"The chaplain--I'll speak to him-must send\n",
       "the refusal.  No summons from Heaven could be more powerful than the call\n",
       "that takes me away.  Bestir yourself!  There is not an instant to lose.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Frau Lamperi retired with drooping head.  But when she had executed her\n",
       "mistress's orders and returned, Barbara laid her hand upon her shoulder,\n",
       "whispering: \"You can keep silence.  I am going to Luxemburg.  He who\n",
       "calls me is one whom you saw enter the world, the hero of Lepanto.  He\n",
       "wants his mother.  At last! at last!  And I--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Here tears stifled her voice, and obeying the desire to pour out to\n",
       "another the overflowing gratitude and love which had taken possession of\n",
       "her soul, she threw herself upon the gray-haired attendant's breast, and\n",
       "amid her weeping exclaimed: \"I shall see him with these eyes, I can clasp\n",
       "his hand, I shall hear his voice--that voice--His first cry--A thousand\n",
       "times, waking and sleeping, I have fancied I heard it again.  Do you\n",
       "remember how they took him from me, Lamperi?\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To think that I survived it!  But now--now  If that voice lured me to the\n",
       "deepest abyss and called me away from paradise, I would go!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The maid's old eyes also overflowed, and when Barbara read her son's\n",
       "letter aloud, she cried: \"Of course there can be no delay, even if,\n",
       "instead of the Rassinghams, King Philip himself should send for you.  And\n",
       "I--may I go with you?  Oh, Madame, you do not know what a sweet little\n",
       "angel he was from his very birth!  We were not allowed to show him to\n",
       "you.  And it was wise, for, had you seen him, it would have broken your\n",
       "poor mother heart to give him up.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She sobbed aloud as she spoke.  Barbara permitted her to accompany her,\n",
       "though she had intended to take her companion, and would have preferred\n",
       "to travel with the woman of noble birth.\n",
       "\n",
       "Besides, she could have confided the care of her sick guest to Lamperi\n",
       "more confidently than to the other.  But the faithful old soul's wish to\n",
       "see the boy whose entrance into the world she had been permitted to greet\n",
       "was too justifiable for her to be able to refuse it.\n",
       "\n",
       "How much Barbara had to do before her departure!  Most of the time was\n",
       "consumed by the suffering maestro and the arrangements which she had to\n",
       "make for him.  She did not leave his bedside until the arrival of the\n",
       "sister who was to assist her companion in nursing her old friend until\n",
       "her return.  She certainly would not be absent long; the important things\n",
       "John had to say might probably require great haste, while, on the\n",
       "contrary, whatever needed time for execution could be comfortably\n",
       "despatched during his stay in the Netherlands.  So she assured Feys, who\n",
       "regarded her as his good angel and felt her departure painfully, that she\n",
       "would soon be with him again, and then gave the order to ask Hannibal\n",
       "Melas, in her name, to pay frequent visits to the sick maestro.  It was\n",
       "very hard for her to leave him and neglect the duties which she had\n",
       "undertaken, but in the presence of the summons addressed to her every\n",
       "other consideration must be silent.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Barbara returned to her own apartments Lamperi was still busied with\n",
       "the packing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Several dresses--first of all the new Brussels gown and its belongings,\n",
       "even the pomegranate blossoms which the garden city of Ghent had supplied\n",
       "as something rare in November for her mistress's adornment--were placed\n",
       "carefully in the largest trunk, while Barbara, overpowered by\n",
       "inexpressible restlessness, paced the room with hasty steps from side to\n",
       "side.\n",
       "\n",
       "Only when one or another article was taken from a casket or box did she\n",
       "pause in her walk.  Among the things selected was the pearl necklace\n",
       "which Charles had given her, and the only note her royal lover had ever\n",
       "written, which ran, \"This evening, quia amore langueo.\"  This she laid\n",
       "with her own hand among the laces and pomegranate blossoms, for this cry\n",
       "of longing might teach her son what she had once been to his father.\n",
       "When John had seen her and felt how clear he was to her, he must become\n",
       "aware that he had another mother besides the Spanish lady whom he called\n",
       "\"Tia,\" and who made his underclothing; then he could no more forget her\n",
       "than that other woman.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lastly, she summoned the major-domo and told him what he must do during\n",

       "The guests invited for Wednesday must be notified; the women's choir must\n",
       "be requested to excuse her non-appearance; Sir Jasper Gordon, her most\n",
       "faithful admirer, an elderly Englishman, must learn that she had gone\n",
       "away; but, above all, writing tablet in hand, she directed him how to\n",
       "provide for her poor, what assistance every individual should receive,\n",
       "or the sums of money and wood which were to be sent to other houses to\n",
       "provide for the coming winter.  She also placed money at the majordomo's\n",
       "disposal for any very needy persons who might apply for help while she\n",
       "was out of reach.\n",
       "\n",
       "Before the November sun had set she entered the La Porta travelling\n",
       "carriage.  The chaplain, whom she referred to the major-domo for any\n",
       "matters connected with the poor, gave his blessing to the departing\n",
       "traveller, whose cheerful vivacity, after so many severe trials, he\n",
       "admired, and whose \"golden heart,\" as he expressed it, had made her dear\n",
       "to him.  The servants gathered at the door of the house, bowing silently,\n",
       "and her \"Farewell, till we meet again!\" fell from her lips with joyous\n",
       "confidence.\n",
       "\n",
       "While on the way she reflected, for the first time, what John could\n",

       "guess, yet whatever it might be she would not fail him.\n",
       "\n",
       "But what could it be'\n",
       "\n",
       "Neither during the long night journey nor by the light of day did she\n",
       "find a satisfactory answer.  True, she had not thought solely of her\n",
       "son's entreaty.  Her whole former life passed before her.\n",
       "\n",
       "How much she had sinned and erred!  But all that she had done for the man\n",
       "to whom the posthorses were swiftly bearing her seemed to her free from\n",
       "reproach and blameless.  Every act and feeling which he had received from\n",
       "her had been the best of which she was capable.\n",
       "\n",
       "Not a day, scarcely an hour, had she forgotten him; for his sake she had\n",
       "endured great anguish willingly, and, in spite of his mute reserve--she\n",
       "could say so to herself--without any bitter feeling.  How she had\n",
       "suffered in parting from her child she alone knew.  Fate had raised her\n",
       "son to the summit of earthly grandeur and saved him from every clanger.\n",
       "Providence had adorned him with its choicest gifts.  When she thought of\n",
       "the last account of him from the Duke of Ferdinandina, it seemed to her\n",
       "as if his life had hitherto resembled a triumphal procession, a walk\n",
       "through blooming gardens.\n",
       "\n",
       "What could he mean by the \"woe\" after the \"weal\"?\n",
       "\n",
       "John was to her the embodied fulfilment of the most ardent prayers.  The\n",
       "blessings she had besought for him, and for which she had placed her own\n",
       "heart on the rack, had become his-glory and splendour, fame and honour.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had not been able to give them to him, and undoubtedly he owed much\n",

       "firmly convinced that her prayers had raised him to his present grandeur.\n",
       "\n",
       "What more could now be given to him?  Everything the human heart desires\n",
       "was already his.  His happiness was complete, and during recent years\n",
       "this, too, had cheered her heart and restored her lost capacity for the\n",
       "enjoyment of life.  She had been carried to the very verge of\n",
       "recklessness whenever bitter grief had oppressed her heart.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her greatest sorrow had been that she was not permitted to see and\n",
       "embrace him, and the knowledge that another filled the place in his heart\n",
       "which belonged to her; but lesser troubles had also gnawed at her soul.\n",
       "\n",
       "It had been especially hard to bear that, as the object of the greatest\n",
       "Emperor's love and the mother of his son, she had so long felt that she\n",
       "was reluctantly tolerated, and not really recognised in the circles which\n",
       "should have been hers also.  Moreover, the consciousness of exercising an\n",
       "art over which she had once attained a mastery, yet never being able to\n",
       "shake off the painful doubt whether the applause that greeted her\n",
       "performance was genuine, spoiled many a pleasant hour.\n",
       "\n",
       "Still, all these things had probably been only the tribute which she was\n",
       "compelled to pay for the proud joy of being the mother of such a son.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now she at last felt safe from these malicious little attacks.  She had\n",
       "gained a good social position; she was not only valued as a singer, but\n",
       "always sought wherever the women of Ghent were earnestly pursuing music\n",
       "and singing.  The invitation to the Rassinghams flung wide the doors\n",
       "which had formerly been closed against her, and she might be sure of not\n",
       "being deemed the least important among the ladies of her party to whose\n",

       "\n",
       "When she returned to Ghent, even if Don John had not been appointed\n",

       "\n",
       "But now that her son entered the Netherlands as the leader, the\n",

       "all meaning for her.\n",
       "\n",
       "She could meet her happy son as a happy mother; she said this to herself\n",

       "Toward evening they reached Luxemburg.  At the gate, where every carriage\n",

       "\n",
       "At the reply the inspector of taxes bowed profoundly, and signed to the\n",

       "\n",
       "Then the carriage rolled on again, and turned into the magnificent park\n",

       "Barbara had often heard, ushered her into the apartments assigned to her.\n",
       "\n",
       "In two hours, he said, the captain-general would be happy to receive her.\n",
       "He first wished her to rest completely after the fatiguing journey.\n",
       "\n",
       "Barbara dismissed, without making use of their services, the pages whom\n",
       "he placed at her disposal.  The more than luxurious meal which was served\n",
       "soon afterward she scarcely touched; the impetuous throbbing of her heart\n",
       "choked her breathing so that she could scarcely speak to Lamperi.\n",
       "\n",
       "With eager zeal the maid tried to induce her to put on the fresh and\n",
       "extremely tasteful Brussels gala robe.  The candlesticks, with the dozens\n",
       "of candles, the elegant silver dishes, the whole manner of the reception,\n",
       "led her to make the suggestion.  But Barbara had scarcely noticed these\n",
       "magnificent things.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her every thought and feeling centred upon the son whom she was now\n",
       "actually to see with her own eyes, whose hand she would touch, whose\n",
       "voice she would hear.\n",
       "\n",
       "The splendid costume did not suit such a meeting after a long separation,\n",
       "so solemn a festal hour of the heart.\n",
       "\n",
       "A heavy black silk which she had brought was more appropriate for this\n",
       "occasion.  Only she allowed the pomegranate blossoms, which had remained\n",
       "perfectly fresh, to be fastened on her breast, that her dress might not\n",
       "look like mourning.  While Lamperi was putting the last touches to her\n",
       "toilet, a priest came for her, as Escovedo had arranged, exactly two\n",
       "hours after her arrival.  This was Father Dorante, Don John's confessor,\n",
       "an elderly man with a face in which earnest piety was so happily mingled\n",
       "with kindly cheerfulness that Barbara rejoiced to know that such a\n",
       "guardian of souls was at her son's side.\n",
       "\n",
       "While he was descending the stairs with her, Barbara noticed one of the\n",
       "searching glances he secretly cast at her, and wondered what this man's\n",
       "pure, keen eyes had probably discovered.\n",
       "\n",
       "The spacious apartment into which she was now ushered was hung with\n",
       "costly bright-hued Oriental rugs.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Gifts from the widow of the Turkish lord high admiral,\" the priest\n",
       "whispered, pointing to the superb textures, and Barbara nodded.  She knew\n",
       "how he had obtained them, but the passionate agitation of her soul\n",
       "deprived her of the power to inform the monk of this knowledge, of which\n",
       "probably she would usually have boasted to a friend of her son so worthy\n",
       "of all respect.\n",
       "\n",
       "The folding doors of the adjoining room were open.  Surely John was\n",
       "there, and how gladly she would have rushed toward it!  But the confessor\n",
       "asked her to sit down, as the captain-general still had several orders to\n",
       "give.  Then he entered the other room.\n",
       "\n",
       "Barbara, panting for breath, looked after him and, as she glanced through\n",
       "the open door, it seemed as though her heart stood still.\n",
       "\n",
       "Yonder aristocratic gentleman, in the full prime of youthful beauty, must\n",
       "be her son.\n",
       "\n",
       "The man from whom she had so long been parted looked like the apparition\n",
       "of the Count Egmont, at whom she had once gazed full of admiration, with\n",
       "the wish that her John might resemble him; only she thought her John,\n",
       "with his open brow and floating, waving golden locks, far handsomer than\n",
       "the unfortunate victor of St. Quentin and Gravelines.\n",
       "\n",
       "How noble and yet how easy was the bearing of the dignitary, who was\n",
       "still less than thirty years old!\n",
       "\n",
       "His figure was only slightly above middle height.  What gave it the air\n",
       "of such royal stateliness?\n",
       "\n",
       "Certainly it was not merely his dress, which consisted wholly of velvet,\n",
       "silk, and satin, with the gold of the Fleece that hung below the lace\n",
       "ruff at his throat.  True, the colours of the costume were becoming.\n",
       "Dark violet and golden yellow alternated in the slashed doublet and wide\n",
       "breeches.  His father had worn similar apparel when he confessed his love\n",
       "for her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Should Barbara regard this as a good omen or an evil one?\n",
       "\n",
       "He was not yet aware of her arrival for, completely absorbed in the\n",
       "subject of their conversation, he was talking with his private secretary\n",
       "Escovedo.\n",
       "\n",
       "How animated his beautiful features became!  how leonine he looked when\n",
       "he indignantly shook his head with its wealth of golden hair!\n",
       "\n",
       "Oh, yes!  Women's hearts must indeed fly to him, and Barbara now\n",
       "understood what she had heard of the beautiful Diana of Sorrento,\n",
       "and the no less beautiful Alaria Mendoza, and their love for him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus she had imagined him.  Yet no!  His outer man, in its proud\n",
       "patrician beauty and winning charm, even surpassed her loftiest\n",
       "expectation.  One thing alone surprised her: the seriousness of his\n",
       "youthful features and the lines upon his lofty brow.\n",
       "\n",
       "Why did her favourite of fortune bear these traces of former anxieties?\n",
       "\n",
       "Now the priest interrupted him.  Had he told her John of her entrance?\n",
       "\n",
       "Yet that was scarcely possible, for his face revealed no trace of filial\n",
       "pleasure.  On the contrary.  He rallied his courage, as if he were about\n",
       "to step into a cold river, straightened himself, and pressed his right\n",
       "hand, clinched into a fist, upon his hip.  Perhaps--the saints be\n",
       "praised!--Father Dorante might have reminded him of something else, for\n",
       "he turned to Escovedo again and gave him an order.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then he waved his hand, flung back his handsome head as King Philip was\n",
       "in the habit of doing, but in a far nobler, freer manner, hastily passed\n",
       "his hand through his wavy hair, as if to strengthen his courage, and then\n",
       "walked slowly, with haughty, almost arrogant dignity, to the door.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the threshold he paused and looked at her.  How bright were the large\n",
       "blue eyes which now gazed at Barbara with an expression far more\n",
       "searching than joyous.\n",
       "\n",
       "Yet even while, with one hand resting on the back of the chair and the\n",
       "other pressed upon her panting bosom, she was striving to find the right\n",
       "words, Don John's glance brightened.\n",
       "\n",
       "She was not mistaken.  He had dreaded this meeting, and now with joyful\n",
       "surprise was asking himself whether this could be the woman who had been\n",
       "described to him as a showy, extremely whimsical, perverse person, who\n",
       "used her son's renown to obtain access to aristocratic houses and as many\n",
       "pleasures as possible.\n",
       "\n",
       "She must at any rate have been remarkably beautiful, and how wonderfully\n",
       "her delicately chiselled features had retained a charm which is usually\n",
       "peculiar to youth! how well the now dull gold of her thick tresses\n",
       "harmonized with the faint flush on the almost unwrinkled face! and how\n",
       "dignified was the bearing of her figure, still slender, in spite of her\n",
       "matronly increase in flesh!\n",
       "\n",
       "No wonder that she had once fired the heart of his distinguished father!\n",
       "Now--that sunny glance could not deceive Barbara--now her appearance had\n",
       "ceased to be unpleasant to him; nay, perhaps even pleased him.  And now\n",
       "she could bear it no longer; from the inmost depths of her heart rose the\n",
       "cry: \"John, my child!  My dear, dear son!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Again, with the speed of lightning, the question darted through Don\n",
       "John's mind: \"Is this the woman whose voice, I was told, offended the\n",
       "ear?  Spiteful, base slander!\"  How fervent, how gentle, how full of\n",
       "tender affection her cry had sounded!  Not even from the lips of Doha\n",
       "Magdalena, his much-loved \"Tia,\" had his own name ever echoed so\n",
       "musically as from those of yonder woman, whom he had just shrunk from\n",
       "meeting as though it were an inevitable misfortune.\n",
       "\n",
       "Shame, regret, love, seethed hotly within him.  It was long since he had\n",
       "felt emotion like that which mastered him when her tearful eyes again met\n",
       "his, and now, in the enthusiastic soul of this favourite of fortune,\n",
       "whose lofty flight neither glory, nor fame, nor disappointment could\n",
       "paralyze, in the bosom of this good, high-minded young human being\n",
       "stirred the consciousness that a great new happiness was in store for\n",
       "him, and from his lips rang the cry for which Barbara had waited so long\n",
       "with vain yearning, \"Mother!\" and again \"Mother!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It seemed to her as if the bright sun had suddenly burst in its full,\n",
       "dazzling radiance from midnight darkness.  Three swift steps took her to\n",
       "Don John and, no longer able to control herself, she seized one of the\n",
       "hands which he had extended to her to kiss it; but his chivalrous nature\n",
       "forbade him to permit this, and at the same moment he had obeyed the\n",
       "impulse to kiss the face upturned to his with such loving tenderness.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the way she had pondered long over the question how she should address\n",
       "him; but now she knew that she need not call him \"Your Excellency,\" far\n",
       "less \"Your Highness.\"  To impose so severe a constraint upon her poor,\n",
       "poor heart was no longer required and, though interrupted by low sobbing,\n",
       "she again cried with all the fervour of the most tender maternal love:\n",
       "\"My son!  My dear, dear child!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Then suddenly the words she had vainly sought came voluntarily, and in\n",
       "fluent speech she told him how her heart had so long consumed itself with\n",
       "yearning for him, and that she had now left everything behind to obey his\n",
       "summons; and he thanked her with eager warmth by raising the hand which\n",
       "clasped his to his lips.\n",
       "\n",
       "What he desired of her would be hard for her to do, but now that he knew\n",
       "her it was far harder to ask.  Yet it must be done, because upon this\n",
       "might perhaps depend the great hopes which he fixed upon the future, and\n",
       "which would atone for what had so cruelly embittered and poisoned the\n",
       "past.\n",
       "\n",
       "Barbara gazed more intently into the noble face whose blooming youthful\n",
       "beauty had just delighted her, and in doing so perceived far more\n",
       "distinctly the sorrowful, anxious expression which she had formerly\n",
       "thought she noticed.  In pained surprise she inquired what cause he, whom\n",
       "Heaven had hitherto loaded with its most precious gifts, had to complain\n",
       "of Fate, as whose spoiled favourite she, like all the rest of the world,\n",
       "had believed him happy.\n",
       "\n",
       "He laughed softly, but with such keen bitterness that it pierced her to\n",
       "the heart, and the bright flush with which joy had suffused her cheeks\n",
       "suddenly vanished.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her favourite of Fortune indignantly rejected the belief that he had\n",
       "reason to look back upon his past life with gratitude and pleasure.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was incomprehensible and, carried away by the violent agitation which\n",
       "seized upon her, she described with fiery vivacity how the conviction\n",
       "that he had gained everything which her hard sacrifice and her prayers\n",
       "had sought, had beautified her life and helped her to bear even the most\n",
       "painful trials with quiet submission, nay, with joyous gratitude.\n",
       "\n",
       "Stimulated by the power of the extraordinary things which she had\n",

       "torn her child from her soul in order to place it in the path which was\n",
       "to lead to fame, splendour, and honour--in short, to everything that\n",
       "adorns and lends value to life.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And why, in the name of all the saints,\" she concluded, \"why must I now\n",
       "tell myself that I endured this great suffering in vain, and that what\n",
       "filled my heart with joy was only an idle delusion?  Yet I watched your\n",
       "steps as the hunter follows the trail of the game.  I saw how every fresh\n",
       "onset led you to greater splendour, higher renown, and more exalted\n",
       "grandeur.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "His cheeks, too, had now flushed.  What life was still pulsing in the\n",
       "veins of this woman, already past her youth! with what impressive power\n",
       "she understood how to describe what moved her!  Yet how mistaken was the\n",
       "view to which maternal love and the desire of her heart had led her\n",
       "artist nature!  She had seen only the light, not the shadow, the\n",
       "darkness, the gloom, which had clouded his course of fame.\n",
       "\n",
       "To secure splendour and grandeur for him, she had yielded to the most\n",

       "\n",
       "How had the happiness in which she fancied she saw him revelling been\n",
       "constituted?\n",
       "\n",
       "The power of the newly awakened experiences bore him away also, and he\n",

       "\n",
       "Yes, indeed!  He had not lacked great successes, far-reaching renown,\n",
       "high honours, and some degree of glory.  But what a tale he--not yet\n",
       "thirty--now related!  He, the son of an Emperor, the brother of a\n",
       "powerful King, who was adorned by as many crowns as there were fingers on\n",
       "his hand!\n",
       "\n",
       "He had been King Philip's servant and useful commander in chief, nothing\n",
       "more.\n",
       "\n",
       "And now he described the sovereign's cold nature, unfeeling calculation,\n",
       "and offensive suspicion.  He, Don John, the not all unworthy son of the\n",
       "great Emperor Charles, was not born to obey all his life, and allow\n",
       "himself to be turned to account, worn out, and abused for the benefit of\n",
       "another.  He, too, might lay claim to the right of governing a kingdom of\n",
       "his own as its ruler, benefactor, and Mehrer.\n",
       "\n",
       "After Lepanto, the crowns of the Morea and Albania had been offered to\n",
       "him.  Then, after he had conquered Tunis for his brother Philip, he had\n",
       "wished to reign over that country as its king.  Had it been ceded to him,\n",
       "large provinces would have been taken from the infidels.  This, it might\n",
       "have been supposed, was sufficient reason for Philip to intrust it to his\n",
       "government.  But although the Holy Father in Rome and other rulers had\n",
       "recognised the justice of these wishes, his royal brother could not be\n",
       "persuaded to grant his just demands, and destroyed these hopes with cruel\n",
       "coldness.  He had not even been induced to recognise him as Infant, as a\n",
       "lawful member of his family.\n",
       "\n",
       "With trivial pretexts, and promises which he never intended to fulfil,\n",
       "the hypocritical, selfish, niggardly man had repulsed, delayed, and put\n",
       "him off.\n",
       "\n",
       "So his life had been spoiled by the most cruel disappointments, by a\n",
       "succession of the bitterest wrongs.  Since Lepanto, no pure happiness had\n",
       "bloomed again for him.  He was a miserable, disappointed, ill-treated\n",
       "man, who could never regain his former happiness until he obtained, on\n",
       "his own account, what he himself called greatness, honour, glory, and\n",

       "him of any inclination to repeat it.  God granted Don Philip the\n",
       "sovereignty.  My oath, my honour, forbid me to rise against him.  He has\n",
       "lost all claim to my love, my gratitude, but he is sure of the fidelity\n",
       "of his ill-treated brother.  Besides,\" he added proudly, \"my wishes mount\n",
       "higher.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Barbara had listened to her son with the utmost eagerness; now, taking a\n",
       "locket from the breast of his doublet, he whispered:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do you know whom this lovely picture represents?  No?  Well, these are\n",
       "the features of the fairest and most unfortunate of women.  Mary Stuart,\n",
       "the hapless Queen of Scotland, the devout, patient sufferer for our holy\n",
       "faith, looks at you from this frame.  She does not refuse me her hand.\n",
       "The Holy Father in Rome and the Guises in France approve the bold\n",

       "I am sure of victory in this conflict.  With the most beautiful of women,\n",
       "I shall gain the crown which I need and which will best suit me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"John!\" Barbara exclaimed, carried away by the daring of this proposal,\n",

       "and your great father.  If I can aid you in its realization----\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You can,\" Don John eagerly interrupted; \"for the first step is to gain\n",

       "be sent back to Spain, thither by sea.  When the troops are once on the\n",
       "way they will steer to England, instead of southward.  But even to embark\n",

       "Spare me the mention of my reasons; but the circumstance that you always\n",
       "opened your house to the Spanish party must fill the King's enemies with\n",
       "distrust of you.  Besides, it is scarcely credible; but you must believe\n",
       "Escovedo, to whom I owe this information.  How petty people in the\n",
       "provinces can be about such matters!  An edict was recently issued which\n",
       "commands the removal of every official who can not prove that the union\n",
       "of the parents who gave him life was consecrated by the Holy Church.\n",
       "Alas, mother, that I should be compelled to wound you at our first\n",

       "you ask of me--It comes so unexpectedly--you have no suspicion how deeply\n",
       "it pierces into the very heart of my life.  I must leave the country\n",
       "which has become my home, the city where prejudice and enmity greeted me,\n",
       "and where I have now obtained the position that befits me.  A venerable\n",

       "look at me so, John, I can--Yet no!--It certainly is not necessary that I\n",
       "should say yes or no at once.  I must first learn whether you--whether\n",
       "the sacrifice I made for your glory and grandeur--it was in Landshut,\n",
       "you know--whether it was really so useless, whether you are in reality as\n",
       "unhappy as you, the fame-crowned, beloved, and lauded child of an\n",
       "Emperor, would have me believe, or whether--Forgive me, John, but before\n",
       "I make this terribly difficult decision I must--yes, I must see clearly.\n",
       "As surely as your hero soul harbours no falsity, it would be unworthy of\n",
       "you to show your mother a distorted image of your inner life; you must\n",
       "confess whether you--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Whether,\" Don John, with a smile of sorrowful bitterness, here\n",
       "interrupted the deeply troubled woman--\"whether, in order to soften your\n",
       "heart, I am not painting in blacker colours than reality requires.  Oh,\n",
       "how little you know me yet!  I would rather this tongue should wither\n",
       "than that I should unchivalrously permit it to deviate one straw's\n",
       "breadth from the truth in order to attain a selfish purpose.  No, mother!\n",
       "My description of the grief which often overpowers this soul was far too\n",
       "lukewarm.  If your first sacrifice was intended to make me a happy man,\n",
       "its effect was no stronger than the light of the candle which is burned\n",
       "amid the radiance of the noonday sun.  Perhaps I should have been happier\n",
       "had I been allowed to grow up in modest circumstances under your tender\n",
       "care; for then my course would have been long and steep, and I should\n",
       "have been forced to climb many steps to reach the point where barriers\n",
       "are fixed to ambition.  But as it is, I began at the place which many of\n",
       "the best men regard as the highest goal.  The great man whom you loved\n",
       "understood life better than you.  Had I obeyed his wish, and in the\n",
       "stillness of the cloister striven for blessings which do not belong to\n",
       "this world, this miserable existence would have seemed less unendurable\n",
       "to me, then doubtless a much wider space would have separated me from\n",
       "despair; for I am so unhappy, mother, that I envy the poor peasant who\n",
       "in the sweat of his brow gathers the harvest which his sterile fields\n",
       "produce; for years I have been as wretched as the captive lion in its\n",
       "cage, the lover whose bride is torn from him on the marriage day.\n",
       "Imagine the wish as a woman, and beside her a magician who, by virtue of\n",
       "the power which he possesses, cries, 'The fulfilment of every desire you\n",
       "strive to attain shall be forever withheld,' and you will have an idea of\n",
       "the devastated existence of the pitiable man who, if it were not sinful,\n",
       "would curse those who gave him the life in which he has long seen nothing\n",
       "save the horrible, jeering spectre of disappointment.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Stop!\" moaned Barbara sorrowfully, pressing her hand upon her brow as\n",
       "if frantic.  \"So even my hardest sacrifice was futile, and what rendered\n",
       "life valuable to my foolish heart was mere delusion and bewildering\n",
       "deception.  What I beheld raising you to the stars, as though with\n",
       "eagles' wings, was a clogging weight; what seemed to me at a distance the\n",
       "bright sunshine irradiating your path, was a Will-o'-the-wisp luring to\n",
       "destruction.  What I thought white, was black, the radiant daylight was\n",
       "dusk and the darkness of night.  Oh, if it were really granted me  Yet,\n",
       "child, you certainly do not know what you are asking.  So, before it\n",
       "comes to the final decision, let me put this one more question: Do you\n",
       "believe, really and firmly, that if the confidence of the States-General\n",
       "permits you to take your army by sea, and you lead it in England and\n",
       "succeed in winning the crown and hand of this--whether she is guilty or\n",
       "not--beautiful, devout, and, whatever errors she has committed, desirable\n",
       "Queen, that the troubles which it is so hard for your ambitious soul to\n",
       "bear will then vanish?  When you have won the woman for whom you yearn,\n",
       "the throne, and the sceptre, will your sore heart be healed and happiness\n",
       "make its joyous entry, and also remain in your soul, that is so hard to\n",
       "satisfy?  For--I see and feel it--it is carried away by the 'More,\n",
       "farther,' of your father.  Can you, my John, have you really the firm\n",
       "conviction that, if this lofty desire is fulfilled, you will be content\n",
       "and believe that you have found the summit and the limit of your feverish\n",
       "struggle upward and forward?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, and again yes,\" cried Don John in a tone of immovably firm belief,\n",
       "while his large eyes beamed upon his mother with an expression of full\n",
       "and genuine trust.  \"The vainglory which your first sacrifice brought me\n",
       "was the source of this life full of bitter disappointment.  The hand of\n",
       "Mary Stuart, the lovely martyr, the woman so lavishly endowed with every\n",
       "mental and physical gift, for whom my heart has yearned ever since I saw\n",
       "her picture, and the crown of England, the symbol of genuine majesty,\n",
       "will transform disappointment into the fulfilment which Heaven has\n",
       "hitherto denied me.  If these both fall to the lot of the son, the\n",
       "mother's sacrifice will not have been in vain; no, it will bring him\n",
       "golden fruit, for the success of this enterprise will bestow upon your\n",
       "John, besides the fleeting radiance, the sun whence the light emanates.\n",
       "It will raise him to the height to which he aspires, and for which Fate\n",
       "destined him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Here he hesitated, for the agitated face of Escovedo, who entered with a\n",

       "occurred.\n",
       "\n",
       "The secretary, Don John's friend and counsellor, did not allow himself to\n",
       "be intimidated by the angry gesture with which his master waved him back,\n",
       "but handed him the paper, exclaiming in a tone ringing with the horror\n",
       "the news had inspired: \"Antwerp attacked by his Majesty's rebellious\n",
       "troops, those in Alst, headed by their Eletto--burned to ashes,\n",
       "plundered, destroyed!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "With a hasty snatch Don John seized the parchment announcing the\n",
       "misfortune, and read it, panting for breath.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Council of Antwerp had addressed it to King Philip, and sent a copy\n",
       "to him, the newly appointed governor.\n",
       "\n",
       "When he let the hand which held the paper fall, he was deadly pale,\n",
       "and gazed around him as though seeking assistance.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then his eyes met those of his mother who, seized with anxious fears,\n",
       "was watching his every movement, and he handed her the fatal sheet,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"And I am to lead this abused people back to love the man who sent them\n",

       "hand, and who let the poor, brave fellows in his service starve and go in\n",

       "never wavered in obedience to the King, hurled in a single day from the\n",
       "height of honour and happiness to a gulf of misery, and become a den of\n",
       "robbers and murderers, who know nothing of God and the King.  Old men,\n",
       "women, and children have been slaughtered by them without distinction,\n",
       "the goods belonging partly to foreign owners have been stolen and burned,\n",
       "and the magnificent Town Hall, with all its treasures of documents and\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Horrible! horrible!\" cried Barbara, and Don John repeated her words,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"And this time with some reason,\" replied Don John in a tone of assent,\n",
       "\"for the men who kindled them are mercenaries of the King, formerly our\n",

       "endeavoured to induce the young man to enter the priesthood.  He wished\n",

       "his companion in youth, in study, and in war, had valiantly supported him\n",

       "a modern lover's actual situation, he might have allowed matters to go\n",
       "as they would, and sunk into an early marriage without one prayer to\n",
       "Heaven for mercy. Now, however, that picture troubled him even more than\n",
       "the bump which he had got upon his head from the tilting table in the\n",
       "lawyer's office, and he was disposed to send the stay-lace back to the\n",
       "candid old man. \"FLORA and I have about equal intellects,\" reasoned he\n",

The tone should be gentle and comforting, with a hint of determination. The speaker is addressing someone affectionately, offering comfort about a challenging situation they are about to face. Include a decision-making moment where the speaker weighs the pros and cons of taking a specific item (like a lantern) for their journey, ultimately deciding to take it for practical reasons. Use simple, yet slightly formal vocabulary, with a focus on clarity and warmth. The sentences should vary in length, with some shorter, direct statements and others slightly longer to convey thoughtfulness. Avoid modern slang or overly complex phrasing, aiming for a timeless, literary feel. Keep the paragraph concise, around 3-4 sentences, and ensure it conveys a sense of care and practicality in the face of potential difficulty."

       "\"Dark and cold too, David,\" said Mrs. Putnam.\n",

       "of it because I doubted whether or no I should take the lantern; but I\n",
       "think I will, since it won't be lighter before I come back.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Sam!\" called Mrs. Putnam, and a curly dark head was thrust in at the\n",
       "door, \"fetch father the lantern; light it first.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The Putnam children were trained to prompt obedience. Sam was almost\n",
       "sixteen, but he made neither delay nor objection. When he brought in the\n",
       "old-fashioned tin lantern you saw that he was a tall boy, with an\n",
       "earnest, pleasant face. He followed his father out of the door, hung the\n",
       "lantern by the side of the wagon seat, and tucked in the worn and ragged\n",
       "buffalo-robe as carefully as possible. His father nodded and smiled as\n",
       "he drove off. Sam stopped a moment to inspect the weather: the air was\n",
       "bitter enough, and not a star to be seen.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Father'll have an awful cold ride,\" he said, as he re-entered the\n",
       "house; \"the wind's northeast, right in his face, and everything is\n",
       "frozen up hard and fast.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Poor father! he has a hard time winters,\" sighed Mrs. Putnam.\n",
       "\n",
       "And indeed he did. A country doctor's life is hard enough; day and night\n",
       "he must drive, in all weather and all seasons; nor does there come to\n",
       "him a time of rest and vacation, for people are always ill somewhere.\n",
       "Dr. Putnam had even a harder time than many others, for the district\n",
       "where he lived was among the hills and forests of upper New Hampshire,\n",
       "where roads were rough, winters bitter, inhabitants few, and doctors\n",
       "scarce. But he had a wife and three children to support, and he could\n",
       "not help himself. Besides, he was a hardy, brave, kindly man, and no\n",
       "night was too stormy, no road too long, if sickness called him. He had\n",
       "always been well till the year before, when an attack of pleurisy took\n",
       "hold of him sharply, and warned him that flesh and blood can not endure\n",
       "more than a given amount of exposure.\n",
       "\n",
       "All this went through Sam's curly head as he mended the fire in the\n",
       "stove, brought in wood, and then went over to the next neighbor's after\n",

       "take tea. Teddy, the baby of the family, was asleep long ago. Mrs.\n",
       "Putnam still sat by the fire knitting when the children came back, rosy,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh, mother, it's awfully cold,\" said the girl. \"I'm so sorry father's\n",
       "gone 'way out to Accomac!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mother,\" said Sam, \"Joe Allen says when he was down to Haverhill last\n",
       "year he saw a man driving stage who had a big coat on all made of\n",
       "fox-skins: wouldn't that be perfectly splendid for father?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, indeed, Sam. My father had one; he gave it to Uncle John when he\n",
       "got command of that whaler I've told you about, the _Emmeline_.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I wish he hadn't,\" said Sam. \"It's down at the bottom of the sea now;\n",
       "and if you'd had it, just think how warm father might have been!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No 'ifs,' Sam; you know we don't allow that little word here.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Sam laughed, and went after his old tin pail of butternuts, and the\n",
       "hammer and stone; but while he cracked them he was thinking very hard\n",
       "indeed, and inside his curly head a plan blossomed which in due time\n",
       "fruited. The little village of Ponds, on whose edge Dr. Putnam's\n",
       "homestead and small farm stood, was nestled in the very heart of the New\n",
       "Hampshire hills. Five miles off a railway ran from the mountains to the\n",
       "sea-board, and there was a station nominally belonging to the town of\n",
       "Sabatis, which lay at least a mile and a half beyond. Ponds, however,\n",
       "was so shut in by the hills that nobody would have suspected a railway\n",
       "near it, except when the south wind brought a shriek of the whistle now\n",
       "and then. North of it lay higher hills, and real mountains miles away,\n",
       "while long stretches of wild forest harbored bears, foxes, even now and\n",
       "then a wild-cat, sometimes a deer, and plenty of smaller game.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sam had been learning to shoot this summer that was just past, and had\n",
       "become a fair shot. More than one partridge had helped out the meals at\n",
       "home, and many a rabbit pie, for he was skillful also at snaring; but he\n",
       "had never tried his hand at larger game. Now, he thought, if only he\n",
       "could kill foxes enough, his father might have a coat. It is true, he\n",
       "had no hound, and he really did not like to go alone fox-hunting; for\n",
       "although he was no coward, the hills were full of precipices, and the\n",
       "woods of windfalls, where, if his gun should accidentally go off and\n",
       "injure him, or his foot slip on a dangerous edge, he might lie till\n",
       "death came without possible help; and his father had taught him long ago\n",
       "the difference between courage and recklessness--taught him that no man\n",
       "has a right to throw away his life or carelessly risk it. Sam had the\n",
       "best sort of courage, that which is considerate and calm.\n",
       "\n",
       "But when he had thought over the matter till he fell asleep, and woke up\n",
       "still busy with it, the dawn seemed to have brought counsel: he\n",
       "remembered old Peter Dupont, a Canadian coal-burner, who lived in a\n",
       "shanty half way up Pine Hill, had a pair of fine hounds, and was said to\n",
       "be one of the best hunters about the village. Sam knew him very well; he\n",
       "had gone up to the shanty many a time with medicine from his father when\n",
       "Pete lay sick with a fever, and he had carried gruel and custard and\n",
       "beef tea from his mother as the old man grew better. It was from him Sam\n",
       "had learned all his tricks of woodcraft, and he remembered now how many\n",
       "fox-skins he had seen nailed against the outside of the little\n",
       "shed--skins that Pete sold at Sabatis when he was out of a coal job, and\n",
       "thereby provided himself with many a bag of meal and kit of salt pork.\n",
       "\n",
       "But Sam must get his mother's consent before he could go hunting with\n",
       "Peter, and it took much coaxing, and many representations of how much\n",
       "his father would enjoy such a coat, to induce her to set aside her\n",
       "fears, and say yes to his repeated prayers. It was harder for her,\n",
       "because both she and Sam did not wish to have the Doctor know anything\n",
       "about it till the success came--if ever it did.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But, Sam dear,\" said Mrs. Putnam, \"have you ever thought how you shall\n",
       "get it made? Even if you get the skins, it will take a good deal of\n",
       "money to pay for lining and making and all.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Sam's face fell. \"I never thought of that, mammy dear; but I am sure\n",
       "there'll be some way. You know what father's always saying--'God helps\n",
       "those that help themselves'; and I'll help myself as hard as I can, and\n",
       "you'll see if there doesn't come a way.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Putnam stroked the curly head fondly; she would not say a word to\n",
       "disturb that honest, child-like faith. Perhaps it taught her a lesson,\n",
       "for she was naturally a doubting, grieving woman.\n",
       "\n",
       "And, to be sure, the very next day the way Sam looked for was opened. A\n",
       "man drove over from Sabatis with an Irish girl who wanted the Doctor to\n",
       "pull a tooth out, for Dr. Pomeroy had gone to New York to see his dying\n",
       "father, and there was no one nearer than Dr. Putnam at the Ponds. But he\n",
       "had gone to the minister's to see a croupy child, so the girl sat down\n",
       "by the fire to wait. As she looked about, her eye fell on a long soft\n",
       "garland of the coral ground-pine which Sam had brought in the day\n",
       "before.\n",

       "\n",
       "It was the year of a Presidential election, and one morning at breakfast\n",
       "Mr. Rovering looked up from his paper to remark, \"My dear, I see there's\n",

       "by every possible means to obtain a glimpse of the reflection from a\n",
       "lantern or to spell out a word now and then on a banner, which by dint\n",
       "of dodging to look under this one's elbow, over that one's head, and\n",

       "We have now reached the fourth year of the Revolution. The British were\n",
       "getting ready to leave Philadelphia. Should the Americans allow them to\n",
       "march across New Jersey unharmed, or should they be followed, and, if\n",
       "possible, be beaten? Lafayette strongly urged that they should be\n",
       "closely chased, and that, if any chance offered, a battle should be\n",
       "fought. General Lee, a very able man, who was next to Washington in\n",
       "rank, opposed this idea. Washington sided with Lafayette, and sent him,\n",
       "with a strong body of men, to follow the British, and take the first\n",
       "opportunity to give them battle. Then Lee changed his mind, and wanted\n",
       "the command which the young Frenchman possessed. \"My fortune and my\n",
       "honor depend upon it,\" he said, and the generous Lafayette gave up the\n",
       "command.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lee managed badly. He retreated when he should have attacked, and\n",
       "ordered Lafayette to give way at the moment that the enemy was about to\n",
       "yield. Lafayette, angry and disgusted, sent word to General Washington\n",
       "that he was needed on the field. Washington galloped forward, took the\n",
       "command from Lee, reformed the troops, and won, after a hard day, the\n",
       "battle of Monmouth. From dawn till midnight Lafayette was in the saddle,\n",
       "now in the thick of the light, now attending by Washington's side, and\n",
       "when the battle was over, the two lay down under the same blanket,\n",
       "beneath the summer stars, and talked of the morrow. When the morrow came\n",
       "the British had stolen away, and all the comfort that Washington and\n",
       "Lafayette had was that though--through no fault of theirs--they had not\n",
       "stopped the enemy, they had rescued the American army from the jaws of\n",
       "defeat.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then they turned their thoughts to the French fleet, which was on its\n",
       "way to the United States. Great hopes were felt that this, with the\n",
       "American army, could capture the British in New York. The Count\n",
       "d'Estaing, a brave and faithful man, was in command of the French. He\n",
       "was very much attached to Lafayette, and had a father's love and a\n",
       "soldier's admiration for the boy hero. He took greatly to the project of\n",
       "capturing New York; but the water was not deep enough at the entrance to\n",
       "the harbor to let his vessels enter. So it was concluded to undertake\n",
       "the capture of Newport, on Rhode Island, where the British had a strong\n",
       "garrison. Lafayette was sent forward with an advance guard to aid in the\n",
       "enterprise, and after a rapid march of 240 miles reached the point of\n",
       "meeting. Then commenced one of the most annoying and unpleasant chapters\n",
       "of Lafayette's experience in America. The French fleet sailed out of\n",
       "Newport to attack an English fleet which had just arrived. In the midst\n",
       "of the fight, when victory seemed sure, a heavy storm arose, scattered\n",
       "the French fleet, tore away masts and rudders, and left most of the\n",
       "vessels helpless. The Count d'Estaing was deeply chagrined, and was\n",
       "compelled to go to Boston for repairs to his fleet. Many of the American\n",
       "officers were angry at this. General Sullivan, in a general order,\n",
       "accused the French of having \"abandoned\" their allies. A protest against\n",
       "the course of Count d'Estaing was drawn up and signed by the American\n",
       "officers. Lafayette was indignant. He would not, of course, sign the\n",
       "protest. He declared to General Sullivan that the slur cast on the Count\n",
       "d'Estaing was a personal insult, and demanded an apology for it. This he\n",
       "obtained. Then he started for Boston, to try to prevent any ill-feeling\n",
       "there toward his countrymen. His letters to Washington at this time are\n",
       "very long, and full of grief and shame that his countrymen should have\n",
       "been so misunderstood. His feelings were expressed in the queerest of\n",
       "English, but they were very sincere. Happily, Washington shared them.\n",
       "Everything was done to keep the peace between the allies, and finally\n",
       "with success. While he was in Boston Lafayette heard that a battle was\n",
       "likely to take place at Newport, where the Americans had landed on the\n",
       "north end of the island, and were attacked by the British. Lafayette\n",
       "mounted his horse, and after riding eighty miles in less than eight\n",
       "hours, reached the field in time to take an honorable part in the\n",
       "retreat which had become necessary. All further operations with the\n",
       "fleet appearing unlikely, he made up his mind to go back to France for a\n",
       "while to join the French army, and fight in the war which seemed about\n",
       "to take place on English soil.\n",
       "\n",
       "A curious incident detained him. During the year 1778 Commissioners had\n",
       "come over from England to offer terms of peace to Congress. But no terms\n",
       "short of independence for the United States would be accepted. Lord\n",
       "Carlisle was the chief of the Commissioners. In one of his letters he\n",
       "warned the Americans not to trust the French, \"whose perfidy was too\n",
       "well known to need further proof.\" Lafayette's fiery blood boiled at\n",
       "this insult to his nation. He straightway challenged Lord Carlisle to a\n",
       "duel. \"I demand of you,\" he wrote, \"an apology as public as was the\n",
       "insult. I hope to add to the glorious privilege of being a Frenchman\n",
       "that of proving to one of your nation that mine can not be attacked with\n",
       "impunity.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was a foolish thing, this challenge. Lord Carlisle very properly\n",
       "replied that he was responsible for his public words only to his\n",
       "government. Washington, in the kindest manner, reminded Lafayette that\n",
       "the chivalrous spirit he had shown was a little out of date, and might\n",
       "make him seem ridiculous in the eyes of sensible men. Besides, even if\n",
       "the duel were to be fought, chance rather than courage often decided\n",
       "this sort of contests, and justice in no case was helped by the result.\n",
       "He could not bear to see a life risked which should be kept for greater\n",
       "and better service. And the brave old Count d'Estaing wrote earnestly to\n",
       "Washington to put a stop to this boyish adventure, and not to permit\n",
       "such a needless exposure of so precious a life.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lafayette returned to France in the early part of 1779. He had left his\n",
       "country in disgrace, under an order of arrest for disobedience to his\n",
       "King. Even his friends had condemned his action as fool-hardy and\n",
       "useless. Nearly all his family had joined in bewailing what they\n",
       "regarded as the ruin of a promising career by enlisting in a hopeless\n",
       "cause. He came back famous and honored. He had won high military rank,\n",
       "and had proved himself, in the words of the American Congress in parting\n",
       "with him, \"wise in council, brave in battle, patient amid the fatigues\n",
       "of war.\" The hopeless cause he had taken up was on the point of victory,\n",
       "and the King who had ordered him to prison for joining it had become the\n",
       "open ally of the new nation.\n",
       "\n",
       "Lafayette was welcomed with open arms, and though still but twenty-one,\n",
       "his advice was sought by both the American and French governments with\n",
       "high respect. Still ardently devoted to the American cause, he sought\n",
       "some opportunity to serve it. He planned first an expedition against the\n",
       "wealthy commercial cities of the English coast, in which he was to\n",
       "command the land-forces, and John Paul Jones, the gallant American\n",
       "sailor who was to be so famous, was to command the fleet. When this fell\n",
       "through, on account of the timidity of the French ministers, Lafayette\n",
       "proposed an attack upon Canada, but this also was a failure. Then, with\n",
       "characteristic independence and courage, he staked all his hopes on\n",
       "getting money, a fleet, and an army for the United States. He had been\n",
       "instructed by Congress not to ask for an army, for the Americans were\n",
       "afraid of the jealousy which foreign troops would excite. But Lafayette\n",
       "believed that a French army might arrive in the nick of time, and decide\n",
       "the result of the war. The event proved that he was right. He returned\n",
       "to America in April, 1780, a few weeks in advance of the French forces,\n",
       "of the coming of which neither the English nor the Americans had any\n",
       "suspicion. Then opened the last year of real war in the struggle for\n",
       "independence. Lafayette was to take a great part in its events, and of\n",

       "of picture cord; this was supposed to represent a worm or a snake (see\n",
       "Fig. 1). Then they fastened this cornucopia on the face of the boy\n",
       "cousin, as represented in Fig. 2. Then they procured a pair of yellow\n",
       "slippers, on which they pinned some slips of brown paper; these they put\n",
       "on the feet of the boy. Then they twisted a sheet around him, so as to\n",
       "hump his back and fill him out generally, and over this they fitted a\n",
       "rough gray shawl, which completed the bird, all except the eyes, which\n",

       "encouraged by the promise that if they each succeeded in getting a\n",
       "mouthful of the bran, they should receive a very large piece of cake by\n",

The paragraph should describe a mentorâ€™s mixed emotions of pride and frustration toward a young fighter who, despite being highly skilled, is currently losing a match to a surprisingly formidable opponent. Use informal, conversational language with regional British dialect influences, such as dropped letters and phonetic spellings, to convey authenticity. Include vivid descriptions of the opponentâ€™s agility, strength, and technique, contrasting them with the mentorâ€™s disappointment in the young fighterâ€™s performance. Employ exclamations, rhetorical questions, and a sense of urgency to heighten the emotional tone. Use boxing-related metaphors and slang to enrich the narrative, and ensure the paragraph reflects the mentorâ€™s deep investment in the young fighterâ€™s success, as well as their growing concern for the outcome of the match. Keep sentences varied in length, with some longer, flowing sentences to build momentum and shorter, punchier ones for emphasis. Aim for a paragraph of similar length and complexity to the original, capturing its energetic and slightly exasperated spirit."

The paragraph should describe a historical figureâ€™s early struggles and intellectual pursuits, focusing on their transient lifestyle and the challenges they faced due to financial hardship. Include a reference to a close but ill-fated friendship, emphasizing the age difference between the two individuals and the timing of their association. Use complex sentence structures with a mix of longer, descriptive sentences and shorter, factual ones to convey depth and detail. Employ elevated vocabulary, such as terms like \"perambulate,\" \"habitation,\" and \"intellectual,\" to maintain a scholarly tone. Avoid direct quotes but subtly suggest the influence of philosophical or moral discussions between the figures. Ensure the paragraph conveys a sense of historical accuracy and introspection, highlighting the contrast between the figuresâ€™ circumstances and their intellectual endeavors. Aim for a length of approximately 150 words, maintaining a balance between narrative flow and factual precision."

       "\"I told you, (said Rudolf) that the lords of Arnheim, though from\n",
       "father to son they were notoriously addicted to secret studies, were,\n",
       "nevertheless, like the other German nobles, followers of war and the\n",
       "chase. This was peculiarly the case with Anne's maternal grandfather,\n",
       "Herman of Arnheim, who prided himself on possessing a splendid stud of\n",

       "For this reason, and the wildness of his disposition, his master had\n",

       "tending to sanction the evil reports which touched the house of Arnheim,\n",
       "being, it was said, the naming of a favourite animal after a foul fiend.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It chanced, one November day, that the baron had been hunting in the\n",
       "forest, and did not reach home till night-fall. There were no guests with\n",
       "him, for, as I hinted to you before, the castle of Arnheim seldom received\n",
       "any other than those from whom its inhabitants hoped to gain augmentation\n",
       "of knowledge. The baron was seated alone in his hall, illuminated with\n",
       "cressets and torches. His one hand held a volume covered with characters\n",
       "unintelligible to all save himself. The other rested on the marble table,\n",
       "on which was placed a flask of Tokay wine. A page stood in respectful\n",
       "attendance near the bottom of the large and dim apartment, and no sound\n",
       "was heard save that of the night wind, when it sighed mournfully through\n",
       "the rusty coats of mail, and waved the tattered banners which were the\n",
       "tapestry of the feudal hall. At once the footstep of a person was heard\n",
       "ascending the stairs in haste and trepidation; the door of the hall was\n",
       "thrown violently open, and, terrified to a degree of ecstasy, Caspar, the\n",
       "head of the baron's stable, or his master of horse, stumbled up almost to\n",
       "the foot of the table at which his lord was seated, with the exclamation\n",
       "in his mouth--'My lord, my lord, a fiend is in the stable!' 'What means\n",
       "this folly?' said the baron, arising, surprised and displeased at an\n",
       "interruption so unusual. 'Let me endure your displeasure,' said Caspar,\n",
       "'if I speak not truth! Apollyon--' Here he paused. 'Speak out, thou\n",
       "frightened fool,' said the baron; 'is my horse sick, or injured?' The\n",
       "master of the stalls again gasped forth the word 'Apollyon!' 'Say on,'\n",
       "said the baron; 'were Apollyon in presence personally, it were nothing to\n",
       "shake a brave man's mind.' 'The devil,' answered the master of the horse,\n",
       "'is in Apollyon's stall!' 'Fool!' exclaimed the nobleman, snatching a\n",
       "torch from the wall; 'what is it that could have turned thy brain in such\n",
       "silly fashion?'\n",
       "\n",
       "\"As he spoke, he crossed the courtyard of the castle, to visit the stately\n",
       "range of stables, where fifty gallant steeds stood in rows, on each side\n",
       "of the ample hall. At the side of each stall hung the weapons of offence\n",
       "and defence of a man-at-arms, as bright as constant attention could make\n",
       "them, together with the buff-coat which formed the trooper's under\n",
       "garment. The baron, followed by one or two of the domestics, who had\n",
       "assembled full of astonishment at the unusual alarm, hastened up betwixt\n",
       "the rows of steeds. As he approached the stall of his favourite horse,\n",
       "which was the uppermost of the right-hand row, the good steed neither\n",
       "neighed, nor shook his head, nor stamped with his foot, nor gave the usual\n",
       "signs of joy at his lord's approach; a faint moaning, as if he implored\n",
       "assistance, was the only acknowledgment of the baron's presence. Sir\n",
       "Herman held up the torch, and discovered that there was indeed a tall,\n",
       "dark figure standing in the stall, resting his hand on the horse's\n",
       "shoulder. 'Who art thou?' said the baron, 'and what dost thou here?' 'I\n",
       "seek refuge and hospitality,' replied the stranger; 'and I conjure thee to\n",
       "grant it me, by the shoulder of thy horse, and by the edge of thy sword,\n",
       "and so as they may never fail thee when thy need is at the utmost.' 'Thou\n",
       "art, then, a brother of the Sacred Fire,' said Baron Herman of Arnheim;\n",
       "'and I may not refuse thee the refuge which thou requirest of me, after\n",
       "the ritual of the Persian Magi. From whom, and for what length of time,\n",
       "dost thou crave my protection?' 'From those,' replied the stranger, 'who\n",
       "shall arrive in quest of me before the morning cock shall crow, and for\n",
       "the full space of a year and a day from this period.' 'I may not refuse\n",
       "thee,' said the baron, 'consistently with my oath and my honour. For a\n",
       "year and a day I will be thy pledge, and thou shall share with me roof and\n",
       "chamber, wine and food. But thou, too, must obey the law of Zoroaster,\n",
       "which, as it says, Let the stronger protect the weaker brother, says also,\n",
       "Let the wiser instruct the brother who hath less knowledge. I am the\n",
       "stronger, and thou shalt be safe under my protection; but thou art the\n",
       "wiser, and must instruct me in the more secret mysteries.' 'You mock\n",
       "your servant,' said the strange visiter; 'but if aught is known to\n",
       "Dannischemend which can avail Herman, his instructions shall be as those\n",
       "of a father to a son.' 'Come forth, then, from thy place of refuge,' said\n",
       "the Baron of Arnheim: 'I swear to thee by the sacred fire which lives\n",
       "without terrestrial fuel, and by the fraternity which is betwixt us, and\n",
       "by the shoulder of my horse, and the edge of my good sword, I will be thy\n",
       "warrand for a year and a day, if so far my power shall extend.'\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The stranger came forth accordingly; and those who saw the singularity of\n",
       "his appearance, scarce wondered at the fears of Caspar, the stall-master,\n",
       "when he found such a person in the stable, by what mode of entrance he was\n",
       "unable to conceive. When he reached the lighted hall to which the baron\n",
       "conducted him, as he would have done a welcome and honoured guest, the\n",
       "stranger appeared to be very tall, and of a dignified aspect. His dress\n",
       "was Asiatic, being a long, black caftan, or gown, like that worn by\n",
       "Armenians, and a lofty, square cap, covered with the wool of Astracan\n",
       "lambs. Every article of the dress was black, which gave relief to the\n",
       "long, white beard that flowed down over his bosom. His gown was fastened\n",
       "by a sash of black silk net-work, in which, instead of a poniard, or\n",
       "sword, was stuck a silver case, containing writing materials and a roll of\n",
       "parchment. The only ornament of his apparel consisted in a large ruby of\n",
       "uncommon brilliancy, which, when he approached the light, seemed to glow\n",
       "with such liveliness, as if the gem itself had emitted the rays which it\n",
       "only reflected back. To the offer of refreshment, the stranger replied,\n",
       "'Baron, I may not eat, water shall not moisten my lips, until the avenger\n",
       "shall have passed by the threshold.' The baron commanded the lamps to be\n",
       "trimmed and fresh torches to be lighted, and sending his whole household\n",
       "to rest, remained sealed in the hall along with the stranger, his\n",
       "suppliant. At midnight, the gates of the castle were shaken as by a\n",
       "whirlwind, and a voice, as if of a herald, was heard to demand his lawful\n",
       "prisoner, Dannischemend, the son of Hali. The warder then heard a lower\n",
       "window of the hall thrown open, and could distinguish his master's voice\n",
       "addressing the person who had thus summoned the castle. But the night was\n",
       "so dark that he might not see the speakers, and the language which they\n",
       "used was either entirely foreign, or so largely interspersed with strange\n",
       "words, that he could not understand a syllable which they said. Scarce\n",
       "five minutes had elapsed, when he who was without, again elevated his\n",
       "voice as before, and said in German, 'For a year and a day, then, I\n",
       "forbear my forfeiture;--but coming for it when that time shall elapse,\n",
       "I come for my right, and will no longer be withstood.'\n",
       "\n",
       "\"From that period Dannischemend, the Persian, was a constant guest at\n",
       "the castle of Arnheim, and, indeed, never for any purpose crossed the\n",
       "drawbridge. His amusements, or studies, seemed centred in the library of\n",
       "the castle, and in the laboratory, where the baron sometimes toiled in\n",
       "conjunction with him for many hours together. The inhabitants of the\n",
       "castle could find no fault in the Magus, or Persian, excepting his\n",
       "apparently dispensing with the ordinances of religion, since he neither\n",
       "went to mass nor confession, nor attended upon other religious ceremonies.\n",
       "It was observed that Dannischemend was rigid in paying his devotions,\n",
       "by prostrating himself in the first rays of the rising sun, and that he\n",
       "constructed a silver lamp of the most beautiful proportions, which he\n",
       "placed on a pedestal representing a truncated column of marble, having\n",
       "its base sculptured with hieroglyphical imagery. With what essences he\n",
       "fed this flame was unknown to all, unless perhaps to the baron; but the\n",
       "flame was more steady, pure, and lustrous, than any which was ever seen,\n",
       "excepting the sun of heaven itself, and it was generally believed that\n",
       "Dannischemend made it an object of worship in the absence of that blessed\n",
       "luminary. Nothing else was observed of him, unless that his morals seemed\n",
       "severe, his gravity extreme, his general mode of life very temperate, and\n",
       "his fasts and vigils of frequent recurrence. Except on particular\n",
       "occasions, he spoke to no one of the castle but the baron.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Winter was succeeded by spring, summer brought her flowers, and autumn\n",
       "her fruits, which ripened and were fading, when a foot-page, who sometimes\n",
       "attended them in the laboratory to render manual assistance when required,\n",
       "heard the Persian say to the Baron of Arnheim, 'You will do well, my son,\n",
       "to mark my words; for my lessons to you are drawing to an end, and there\n",
       "is no power on earth which can longer postpone my fate.' 'Alas, my\n",
       "master!' said the baron, 'and must I then lose the benefit of your\n",
       "direction, just when your guiding hand becomes necessary to place me on\n",
       "the very pinnacle of the temple of wisdom?' 'Be not discouraged, my son,'\n",
       "answered the sage; 'I will bequeath the task of perfecting you in your\n",
       "studies to my daughter, who will come hither on purpose. But remember, if\n",
       "you value the permanence of your family, look not upon her as aught else\n",
       "than a helpmate in your studies; for if you forget the instructress in the\n",
       "beauty of the maiden, you will be buried with your sword and your shield,\n",
       "as the last male of your house; and farther evil, believe me, will arise;\n",
       "for such alliances never come to a happy issue, of which my own is an\n",
       "example.--But, hush, we are observed.' The household of the castle of\n",
       "Arnheim having but few things to interest them, were the more eager\n",
       "observers of those which came under their notice; and when the termination\n",
       "of the period when the Persian was to receive shelter in the castle began\n",
       "to approach, some of the inmates, under various pretexts, but which\n",
       "resolved into every terror, absconded,--while others held themselves in\n",
       "expectation of some striking and terrible catastrophe. None such, however,\n",
       "took place; and, on the expected anniversary, long ere the witching hour\n",
       "of midnight, Dannischemend terminated his visit in the castle of Arnheim,\n",
       "by riding away from the gate in the guise of an ordinary traveller.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The baron had meantime taken leave of his tutor with many marks of\n",
       "regret, and some which amounted even to sorrow. The sage Persian comforted\n",
       "him by a long whisper, of which the last part only was heard, 'By the\n",
       "first beam of sunshine she will be with you. Be kind to her, but not over\n",
       "kind.' He then departed, and was never again seen or heard of in the\n",
       "vicinity of Arnheim. The baron was observed during all the day after the\n",
       "departure of the stranger to be particularly melancholy. At dawn of the\n",
       "ensuing morning, Sir Herman summoned his page; and having performed his\n",
       "toilet, he waited till the sun had just appeared above the horizon, and,\n",
       "taking from the table the key of the laboratory, which the page believed\n",
       "must have lain there all night, he walked thither, followed by his\n",
       "attendant. At the door the baron made a pause, and seemed at one time to\n",
       "doubt whether he should not send away the page, at another to hesitate\n",
       "whether he should open the door, as one might do who expected some strange\n",
       "sight within. He pulled up resolution, however, turned the key, threw the\n",
       "door open, and entered. The page followed close behind his master, and was\n",
       "astonished to the point of extreme terror at what he beheld, although the\n",
       "sight, however extraordinary, had in it nothing save what was agreeable\n",
       "and lovely. The silver lamp was extinguished, or removed from its\n",
       "pedestal, where stood in place of it a most beautiful female figure in the\n",
       "Persian costume, in which the colour of pink predominated. But she wore\n",
       "no turban, or head-dress of any kind, saving a blue riband drawn through\n",
       "her auburn hair and secured by a gold clasp, the outer side of which was\n",
       "ornamented by a superb opal, which, amid the changing lights peculiar\n",
       "to that gem, displayed a slight tinge of red, like a spark of fire.\n",
       "The figure of this young person was rather under the middle size, but\n",
       "perfectly well formed; the eastern dress, with the wide trousers gathered\n",
       "round the ankles, made visible the smallest and most beautiful feet which\n",
       "had ever been seen, while hands and arms of the most perfect symmetry\n",
       "were partly seen from under the folds of the robe. The little lady's\n",
       "countenance was of a lively and expressive character, in which spirit and\n",
       "wit seemed to predominate; and the quick, dark eye, with its beautifully\n",
       "formed eyebrow, seemed to presage the arch remark, to which the rosy and\n",
       "half-smiling lip appeared ready to give utterance. The pedestal on which\n",
       "she stood, or rather was perched, would have appeared unsafe had any\n",
       "figure heavier than her own been placed there. But, however she had been\n",
       "transported thither, she seemed to rest on it as lightly and safely as a\n",
       "linnet, when it has dropped from the sky on the tendril of a rose-bud. The\n",
       "first beam of the rising sun, falling through a window directly opposite\n",
       "to the pedestal, increased the effect of this beautiful figure, which\n",
       "remained as motionless as if it had been carved in marble. She only\n",
       "expressed her sense of the Baron of Arnheim's presence by something of a\n",
       "quicker respiration, and a deep blush, accompanied by a slight smile.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The Baron of Arnheim, for an instant, stood without breath or motion.\n",
       "At once, however, he seemed to recollect that it was his duty to welcome\n",
       "the fair stranger to his castle, and to relieve her from her precarious\n",
       "situation. He stepped forward accordingly with the words of welcome on his\n",
       "tongue, and was extending his arms to lift her from the pedestal, which\n",
       "was nearly six feet high; but the light and active stranger merely\n",
       "accepted the support of his hand, and descended on the floor as light and\n",
       "as safe as if she had been formed of gossamer. It was, indeed, only by the\n",
       "momentary pressure of her little hand, that the Baron of Arnheim was made\n",
       "sensible that he had to do with a being of flesh and blood. 'I am come as\n",
       "I have been commanded,' she said, looking around her: 'you must expect a\n",
       "strict and diligent mistress, and I hope for the credit of an attentive\n",
       "pupil.' After the arrival of this singular and interesting being in the\n",
       "castle of Arnheim, various alterations took place within the interior of\n",
       "the household. A lady of high rank and small fortune, the respectable\n",
       "widow of a count of the empire, who was the baron's blood relation,\n",
       "received and accepted an invitation to preside over her kinsman's domestic\n",
       "affairs, and remove, by her countenance, any suspicions which might arise\n",
       "from the presence of Hermione, as the beautiful Persian was generally\n",
       "called. The countess Waldstetten carried her complaisance so far, as to\n",
       "be present on almost all occasions, whether in the laboratory or library,\n",
       "when the Baron of Arnheim received lessons from, or pursued studies with,\n",
       "the young and lovely tutor, who had been thus strangely substituted for\n",
       "the aged Magus. If this lady's report was to be trusted, their pursuits\n",
       "were of a most extraordinary nature, and the results which she sometimes\n",
       "witnessed were such as to create fear as well as surprise. But she\n",
       "accordingly vindicated them from practising unlawful arts, or overstepping\n",
       "the boundaries of natural science. A better judge of such matters, the\n",
       "Bishop of Bamberg himself, made a visit to Arnheim, on purpose to witness\n",
       "the wisdom of which so much was reported through the whole Rhine country.\n",
       "He conversed with Hermione, and found her deeply impressed with the truths\n",
       "of religion, and so perfectly acquainted with its doctrines, that he\n",
       "compared her to a doctor of theology in the dress of an Eastern\n",
       "dancing-girl. When asked regarding her knowledge of languages and science,\n",
       "he answered that he had been attracted to Arnheim by the most extravagant\n",
       "reports on these points, but that he must return confessing 'the half\n",
       "thereof had not been told unto him.'\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Meantime a marked alteration began to take place in the interviews\n",
       "between the lovely tutor and her pupil. These were conducted with the same\n",
       "caution as before, and never, so far as could be observed, took place\n",
       "without the presence of the countess of Waldstetten, or some other third\n",
       "person of respectability. But the scenes of these meetings were no longer\n",
       "the scholar's library, or the chemist's laboratory;--the gardens, the\n",
       "groves, were resorted to for amusement, and parties of hunting and\n",
       "fishing, with evenings spent in the dance, seemed to announce that the\n",
       "studies of wisdom were for a time abandoned for the pursuits of pleasure.\n",
       "It was not difficult to guess the meaning of this; the Baron of Arnheim\n",
       "and his fair guest, speaking a language different from all others, could\n",

       "fortune attracted less envy than might have been expected in a case so\n",
       "singular. Above all, her generosity amazed and won the hearts of all the\n",

       "that exercise in Germany, having been her partner for half an hour, was\n",
       "compelled to break off the dance and throw himself, totally exhausted,\n",
       "on a couch, exclaiming he had been dancing not with a woman, but with an\n",
       "_ignis fatuus_. Other whispers averred, that while she played with her\n",
       "young companions in the labyrinth and mazes of the castle gardens at\n",
       "hide-and-seek, or similar games of activity, she became animated with the\n",
       "same supernatural alertness which was supposed to inspire her in the\n",
       "dance. She appeared amongst her companions, and vanished from them with\n",
       "a degree of rapidity which was inconceivable; and hedges, treillage, or\n",
       "such like obstructions, were surmounted by her in a manner which the most\n",
       "vigilant eye could not detect; for, after being observed on the other side\n",
       "of the barrier at one instant, in another she was beheld close beside the\n",
       "spectator. In such moments, when her eyes sparkled, her cheeks reddened,\n",
       "and her whole frame became animated, it was pretended that the opal clasp\n",
       "amid her tresses, the ornament which she never laid aside, shot forth the\n",
       "little spark, or tongue of flame, which it always displayed, with an\n",
       "increased vivacity. In the same manner, if in the twilight hall the\n",
       "conversation of Hermione became unusually animated, it was believed that\n",
       "the jewel became brilliant, and even displayed a twinkling and flashing\n",
       "gleam which seemed to be emitted by the gem itself, and not produced in\n",
       "the usual manner, by the reflection of some external light. Her maidens\n",
       "were also heard to surmise, that when their mistress was agitated by any\n",
       "hasty or brief resentment (the only weakness of temper which she was ever\n",
       "observed to display,) they could observe dark-red sparks flash from the\n",
       "mystic brooch, as if it sympathized with the wearer's emotions. The women\n",
       "who attended on her toilette farther reported, that this gem was never\n",
       "removed but for a few minutes, when the baroness' hair was combed out;\n",
       "that she was unusually pensive and silent during the time it was laid\n",
       "aside, and particularly apprehensive when any liquid was brought near it.\n",
       "Even in the use of holy water at the door of the church, she was observed\n",
       "to omit the sign of the cross on the forehead, for fear, it was supposed,\n",

       "\"These singular reports did not prevent the marriage of the Baron of\n",
       "Arnheim from proceeding as had been arranged. In the course of twelve\n",
       "months the lovely baroness presented her husband with a daughter, which\n",
       "was to be christened Sibylla, after the count's mother. As the health of\n",
       "the child was excellent, the ceremony was postponed till the recovery of\n",

       "society the part of a malicious fairy in a minstrel's tale. This was the\n",
       "Baroness of Steinfeldt, famous in the neighbourhood for her insatiable\n",
       "curiosity and overweening pride. She had not been many days in the castle,\n",
       "ere, by the aid of a female attendant, who acted as an intelligencer,\n",
       "she had made herself mistress of all that was heard, said, or suspected,\n",
       "concerning the peculiarities of the Baroness Hermione. It was on the\n",
       "morning of the day appointed for the christening, while the whole company\n",
       "were assembled in the hall, and waiting till the baroness should appear,\n",
       "to pass with them to the chapel, that there arose between the censorious\n",
       "and haughty dame whom we have just mentioned, and the Countess\n",
       "Waldstettin, a violent discussion concerning some point of disputed\n",
       "precedence. It was referred to the Baron von Arnheim, who decided in\n",
       "favour of the countess. Madame de Steinfeldt instantly ordered her palfrey\n",
       "to be prepared, and her attendants to mount. 'I leave this place,' said\n",
       "she, 'which a good Christian ought never to have entered; I leave a house\n",
       "of which the master is a sorcerer, the mistress a demon who dares not\n",
       "cross her brow with holy water, and their trencher companion one who for\n",
       "a wretched pittance is willing to act as match-maker between a wizard and\n",
       "an incarnate fiend!' She then departed, with rage in her countenance,\n",
       "and spite in her heart. The Baron of Arnheim then stepped forward, and\n",
       "demanded of the knights and gentlemen around, if there were any among them\n",
       "who would dare to make good with his sword the infamous falsehoods thrown\n",
       "upon himself, his spouse, and his kinswoman. There was a general answer,\n",
       "utterly refusing to defend the Baroness of Steinfeldt's words in so bad a\n",
       "cause, and universally testifying the belief of the company that she spoke\n",
       "in the spirit of calumny and falsehood. 'Then let that lie fall to the\n",
       "ground which no man of courage will hold up,' said the Baron of Arnheim;\n",
       "'only, all who are here this morning shall be satisfied whether the\n",
       "Baroness Hermione doth or doth not share the rites of Christianity.'\n",
       "The Countess of Waldstetten made anxious signs to him while he spoke\n",
       "thus; and when the crowd permitted her to approach near him, she was\n",
       "heard to whisper,--'O, be not rash! try no experiment! there is something\n",
       "mysterious about that opal talisman; be prudent, and let the matter pass\n",
       "by.' The baron, who was in a more towering passion than well became the\n",

       "retained his purpose.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The Baroness of Arnheim at this moment entered the hall, looking just so\n",
       "pale from her late confinement as to render her lovely countenance more\n",
       "interesting, if less animated, than usual. Having paid her compliments\n",
       "to the assembled company, she was beginning to inquire why Madame de\n",
       "Steinfeldt was not present, when her husband made the signal for the\n",
       "company to move forward to the chapel, and lent the baroness his arm to\n",
       "bring up the rear. The chapel was nearly filled by the splendid company,\n",
       "and all eyes were bent on their host and hostess as they entered the place\n",
       "of devotion immediately after four young ladies, who supported the infant\n",
       "babe in a light and beautiful litter. As they passed the threshold, the\n",
       "baron dipt his finger in the font-stone and offered holy-water to his\n",
       "lady, who accepted it, as usual, by touching his finger with her own. But\n",
       "then, as if to confute the calumnies of the malevolent lady of Steinfeldt,\n",
       "with an air of sportive familiarity which was rather unwarranted by the\n",
       "time and place, he flirted on her beautiful forehead a drop or two of the\n",
       "moisture which remained on his own hand. The opal, on which one of these\n",
       "drops had lighted, shot out a brilliant spark like a falling star, and\n",
       "became the instant afterwards lightless and colourless as a common pebble,\n",
       "while the beautiful baroness sunk on the floor of the chapel with a deep\n",
       "sigh of pain. All crowded around her in dismay. The unfortunate Hermione\n",
       "was raised from the ground and conveyed to her chamber; and so much did\n",
       "her countenance and pulse alter within the short time necessary to do\n",
       "this, that those who looked upon her pronounced her a dying woman. She was\n",
       "no sooner in her own apartment than she requested to be left alone with\n",
       "her husband. He remained an hour in the room, and when he came out he\n",
       "locked and double locked the door behind him. He then betook himself to\n",
       "the chapel, and remained there for an hour or more, prostrated before the\n",
       "altar. In the meantime most of the guests had dispersed in dismay; though\n",
       "some abode out of courtesy or curiosity. There was a general sense of\n",
       "impropriety in suffering the door of the sick lady's apartment to remain\n",
       "locked; but, alarmed at the whole circumstances of her illness, it was\n",
       "some time ere any one dared disturb the devotions of the baron. At length\n",
       "medical aid arrived, and the Countess of Waldstetten took upon her to\n",
       "demand the key. She spoke more than once to a man who seemed incapable of\n",
       "hearing, at least of understanding, what she said. At length he gave her\n",
       "the key, and added sternly, as he did so, that all aid was unavailing, and\n",
       "that it was his pleasure that all strangers should leave the castle. There\n",
       "were few who were inclined to stay; when upon opening the door of the\n",
       "chamber in which the baroness had been deposited little more than two\n",
       "hours before, no traces of her could be discovered, unless that there was\n",
       "about a handful of light grey ashes, like such as might have been produced\n",
       "by burning fine paper, found on the bed where she had been laid. A solemn\n",
       "funeral was nevertheless performed, with masses and all other spiritual\n",

       "Quoting from the same poem, we may truly say of Sawston Hall,\n",
       "Cambridgeshire--\"The mansion's self is vast and venerable,\"--for it is\n",
       "one of the most pleasing architectural relics of the \"elder time,\" which\n",
       "at present exists in England. The house, a large, old, substantial\n",
       "mansion, built partly, as says the tradition, from the walls of Cambridge\n",
       "Castle, has been the property of the Roman Catholic family of Huddleston,\n",
       "for some centuries; and assuming its present appearance early in the reign\n",
       "of Queen Mary, has, with only the trifling alterations incidental to\n",
       "necessary repairs, retained it; for the Huddlestons, inhabiting Sawston\n",
       "Hall, and residing there in each generation, highly respected as country\n",
       "gentlemen, either from the extravagance of some of the family, or from a\n",
       "taste for old associations, have been prevented from altering it. As the\n",
       "manor house, it stands near the church; the baronial chiefs who were\n",
       "always lords of the manor, frequently building, if seldom patronizing,\n",
       "their village churches.\n",
       "\n",
       "The mansion is a large, square building, situated in a garden, wherein may\n",
       "be observed the remains of _aggera_, a moat, terrace, &c.; a river so\n",
       "shallow that it might be easily forded, flows at the back of the house,\n",
       "and serves as one boundary to this garden. In the very small inner court,\n",
       "stands a tower, enclosing a spiral staircase, which leads to the top of\n",
       "the house; the whole length of the southern front of it is occupied by a\n",
       "gallery, and the dormitories upon this floor, which communicate with each\n",
       "other, are hung with old tapestry. The principal entrance is through a\n",
       "porch and door, which opens immediately into the baronial hall, a curious\n",
       "place certainly, but slightly differing in arrangement and appearance from\n",
       "what we had previously seen at Arundel Castle, Haddon Hall, and several\n",
       "colleges. The oriel window, instead of its usual place at the upper end of\n",
       "the hall, was situated on one side, very near the corner; in the recess\n",
       "formed by it, stood the baron's table, not as we had anticipated upon a\n",
       "dais, but at least so veiled from the vulgar gaze of the retainers who\n",
       "feasted at a separate board in the apartment, that it answered the purpose\n",
       "of distinguishing ranks equally well. The hall is paved with red brick,\n",
       "and has a large, open fire-place, intimating well the hospitable spirit of\n",
       "former days; its panels, curiously carved, are painted white and brown;\n",
       "the latter in imitation of walnut wood, is probably a mere coating of\n",
       "paint drawn over the original panels of that material, to ensure their\n",
       "preservation. Here too are the arms of the family emblazoned, in which\n",
       "may be observed the lion of Britain and Fleur-de-lis of France, the\n",
       "Huddlestons being descended from, or united to, the royal line of each\n",
       "nation.\n",
       "\n",
       "There is, near the hall, an ancient refectory, or dining-room, shut up,\n",
       "and in so dangerous a state as to require to be filled with props to\n",
       "support its ceiling. The grand staircase, which is of oak, and coeval with\n",
       "the building, leads to the gallery, in which are situated the principal\n",
       "sleeping-rooms, distinguished as the green, blue, red chambers, &c.,\n",
       "according to the predominant colours of the ancient and faded tapestry\n",
       "with which they are hung; nor would the old manor-house deserve the name\n",
       "of such, was there not in one of these a concealed door behind the arras,\n",
       "and in another, the report at least of a ghost. A narrow door, near the\n",
       "end of the gallery, opens immediately upon an old and narrow staircase,\n",
       "the ascent to that chapel in the very roof of the building, which at the\n",
       "period of the Reformation, was contrived and fitted up for the secret\n",
       "advantage of the Roman Catholic proprietors of Sawston; this chamber, for\n",
       "it is nothing more, is certainly little calculated to impress the mind\n",
       "of the spectator with an idea of the splendour of Catholic worship; we\n",
       "approached it by a narrow decaying staircase, stepped over bare rafters,\n",
       "and were scarcely able to pilot ourselves securely by the faint\n",
       "glimmerings of day-light, streaming through the chinks in the tiling\n",
       "overhead. Upon the opening of the chapel door, however, a full tide of\n",
       "light greeted us, admitted by a dormer window, and this displayed an\n",
       "apartment, known by its altar and benches to be appropriated to sacred\n",
       "purposes, the sole decorations of whose plain white-washed walls were some\n",
       "few engravings of madonnas, saints, and holy families, &c., chiefly\n",
       "French, and not particularly beautiful or valuable.\n",
       "\n",
       "On returning from the chapel we were shown an ingenious hiding-place for\n",
       "the priest in troublous times: a cell covered by a trap-door in the\n",
       "staircase, and just large enough to contain one person, a small table, and\n",
       "a stool; whilst a loop-hole in the wall admitted an apology for light and\n",
       "air. Of heir-looms, there are at Sawston Hall, plenty of curious old\n",
       "pictures and engravings, books, missals, a real relic of chivalry, (light,\n",
       "well-poised, and made of the true lance-wood,) a tilting lance; Queen\n",

       "through him immediately descended from several considerable scholars, and\n",
       "remotely (as one of his biographers, Mr. Field, asserts) from Sir W. Parr,\n",
       "who lived in the reign of Edward IV., and whose granddaughter was Queen\n",
       "Catharine Parr, of famous memory. It does not appear from Parr's writings\n",

       "name of Catharine, which he gave to one of his daughters, may be imagined\n",
       "to imply as much. His mother, whose maiden name was Mignard, was of the\n",
       "family of the celebrated painter. It was the accident of Parr's birthplace\n",
       "that, probably, laid the foundation of his fame, for to the school of his\n",
       "native village, then one of the most flourishing in England, he was sent\n",
       "in his sixth year; whilst, under other circumstances, it is likely that\n",

       "In his boyhood, he is described by his sister, Mrs. Bowyear, as studious\n",
       "after his kind, delighting in Mother Goose and the Seven Champions, and\n",
       "not partaking much in the sports usual to such an age. He had a very\n",
       "early inclination for the church, and the elements of that taste for\n",
       "ecclesiastical pomp, which distinguished him in after life, appeared when\n",
       "he was not more than nine or ten years old. He would put on one of his\n",

       "him, as Hannah did his namesake, with a little gown and cassock;) he would\n",
       "then read the church service to his sister and cousins, after they had\n",
       "been duly summoned by a bell tied to the banisters; preach them a sermon,\n",
       "which his congregation was apt to think, in those days, somewhat of the\n",
       "longest; and even, in spite of his father's remonstrances, would bury a\n",
       "bird or a kitten (Parr had always a great fondness for animals) with the\n",
       "rites of Christian burial. Samuel was his mother's darling; she indulged\n",
       "all his whims, consulted his appetite, and provided hot suppers for him\n",
       "almost from his cradle. He was her only son, and was at this time very\n",
       "fair and well-favoured. Providence, however, foreseeing that at all events\n",
       "vanity was to be a large ingredient in Parr's composition, sent him,\n",

       "\n",
       "The doctor must have found in the course of his practice, that there\n",

       "the mixture;\" and was not prepared for that kind of Greek with which old\n",
       "Fuller's doctor was imbued, who, on being asked why it was called a\n",
       "_Hectic_ fever, \"Because,\" saith he, \"of an _hecking_ cough which ever\n",
       "attendeth that disease.\" Accordingly, Parr having in vain tried to\n",
       "reconcile himself to the \"uttering of mortal drugs\" for three years, was\n",
       "at length suffered to follow his own devices, and in 1765, was admitted of\n",
       "Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Dr. Farmer was at that time tutor. Of this\n",
       "proficient in black letter (he was one of the earliest, and perhaps _the_\n",
       "cleverest, of his tribe) we are told by Archdeacon Butler, in a note, that\n",
       "he was a man of such singular indolence, as to neglect sending in the\n",
       "young men's accounts, and is supposed to have burnt large sums of money,\n",
       "by putting into the fire unopened letters, which contained remittances,\n",
       "conveyed remonstrances, and required answers.\n",
       "\n",
       "At college Parr remained about fourteen months, when his resources were\n",
       "cut off by the sudden death of his father. On balancing his accounts,\n",
       "three pounds seventeen shillings appeared to be all his worldly wealth;\n",
       "and it has been asserted by one of the many persons who have contributed\n",
       "their quota to the memorabilia of Parr, that had he been aware beforehand\n",
       "of possessing so considerable a sum, he would have continued longer in\n",
       "an university which he quitted with a heavy heart, and which he was ever\n",
       "proud to acknowledge as his literary nursing-mother. It is melancholy\n",
       "to reflect on the numbers of young men who squander the opportunities\n",
       "afforded them at Cambridge, and Oxford, without a thought; \"casting the\n",
       "pearl away, like the Aethiop,\" while, at the very moment, many are the sons\n",
       "of genius and poverty, who, with Parr, are struggling in vain to hold fast\n",
       "their chance of the learning, and the rewards of learning, to be gained\n",
       "there, and which would be to them instead of house and land. Thus were\n",
       "Parr's hopes again nipped in the bud, and those years, (the most valuable\n",
       "of all, perhaps, for the formation of character,) the latter years of\n",
       "school and college life, were to him a blank. Meanwhile Dr. Sumner, then\n",
       "master of Harrow, offered him the situation of his first assistant. With\n",
       "this Parr closed; he took deacon's orders in 1769; and five years passed\n",
       "away, as usefully and happily spent as any which he lived to see. It was\n",
       "while he was under-master of Harrow that he lost his cousin, Frank Parr,\n",
       "then a recently elected Fellow of King's College. Parr loved him as a\n",
       "brother; and, though himself receiving a salary of only fifty pounds a\n",
       "year, and, as he says, and as may be well believed, \"then very poor,\"\n",
       "he cheerfully undertook for Frank, by way of making his death-bed more\n",
       "comfortable, the payment of all his Cambridge debts, which proved to be\n",
       "two hundred and twenty-three pounds; a promise which, it is needless to\n",
       "say, he faithfully kept, besides settling an annuity of five pounds upon\n",
       "his mother.\n",
       "\n",
       "In 1771, when Parr was in his twenty-fifth year, Dr. Sumner was suddenly\n",
       "carried off by apoplexy. Parr now became a candidate for the head\n",
       "mastership of Harrow, founding his claims on being born in the town,\n",
       "educated at the school, and for some years one of the assistants. The\n",
       "governors, however, preferred Dr. Benjamin Heath, an antagonist by whom\n",
       "it was no disgrace to be beaten, and whose personal merit Parr himself\n",
       "allowed to justify their choice. A rebellion among the boys, many of whom\n",
       "took Parr's part, ensued; and in an evil hour he threw up his situation\n",
       "of assistant, and withdrew to Stanmore, a village a very few miles from\n",
       "Harrow. Here he was followed by forty of the young rebels, and with this\n",
       "stock in trade he proceeded to set up a school on his own account. This,\n",
       "Dr. Johnstone thinks, was the crisis of Parr's life. The die had turned\n",
       "up against him, and the disappointment, with its immediate consequences,\n",
       "gave a complexion to his future fortunes, character, and comfort. He had\n",
       "already mounted a full-bottomed wig when he stood for Harrow, anxious, as\n",
       "it should seem, to give his face a still further chance of keeping its\n",
       "start. He now began to ride on a black saddle, and bore in his hand a long\n",
       "wand with an ivory head, like a crosier in high prelatical pomp. His\n",
       "neighbours, who wondered what it could all mean, had scarcely time to\n",
       "identify him with his pontificals, before they saw him stalking along the\n",
       "street in a dirty, striped dressing-gown. A wife was all that was now\n",
       "wanted to complete the establishment at Stanmore, and accordingly Miss\n",
       "Jane Marsingale, a lady of an ancient Yorkshire family, was provided for\n",
       "him, (Parr, like Hooker, appears to have courted by proxy, and with about\n",
       "the same success,) and so Stanmore was set a going as the rival of Harrow.\n",
       "These were fearful odds, and it came to pass, that in spite of \"Attic\n",

       "the perpetual recitation of the fragment in praise of Harmodius and\n",

       "five years, Parr was not sorry to accept the mastership of an endowed\n",

       "and a daughter in the spring of 1777. Here he took priest's orders at the\n",

Use simple, straightforward sentences with a touch of literary flair, and include a hint of wry observation about the nature of the subject being discussed. The vocabulary should be accessible but not overly simplistic, with a focus on clarity and natural flow. The paragraph should end with a definitive statement that suggests closure or certainty, even if the preceding thoughts are somewhat ambiguous.

       "family papers, fishing out ancient documents, partly out of curiosity,\n",
       "partly from an unaccountable presentiment.  He had been there about an\n",

       "had been found inside another box belonging to the Belward-Staplings, a\n",
       "distant branch of the family.  These had asked for certain ancient papers\n",
       "lately, and a search had been made, with this result.  The little box was\n",

       "of the Belward-Staplings was not needed again.  Gaston felt that here was\n",

       "of--his grandfather's--money on the Party?  His reply to himself was\n",
       "cynical: the game was not worth the candle.  What had he got out of it\n",
       "all?  Money?  Yes: and he enjoyed that--the power that it gave--\n",

       "himself slipping away from her.  With the tenderness he felt, he still\n",
       "knew that he was acting; imitating, reproducing other, better, moments\n",
       "with her.  He felt the disrespect to her, but it could not be helped--it\n",
       "could not be helped.\n",
       "\n",
       "He said that he would call and say good-bye to her and Mrs. Gasgoyne at\n",
       "four o'clock.  Then he left.  He went to his chambers, gave Jacques\n",
       "instructions, did some writing, and returned at four.  Mrs. Gasgoyne had\n",
       "not come back.  She had telegraphed that she would not be in for lunch.\n",
       "There was nothing remarkable in Gaston's and Delia's farewell.  She\n",

       "that she trusted him, and was anxious that he should be, as she put it\n",
       "gaily, \"comfy.\"  She was composed.  The cleverest men are blind in the\n",
       "matter of a woman's affections; and Gaston was only a mere man, after\n",

       "students and artists, a few great men and a host of small men:\n",
       "Collarossi's school here and Delacluse's there: models flitting in and\n",

       "a club in the Boulevard Malesherbes bored him.  It was merely Anglo-\n",
       "American enjoyment, dashed with French drama.  The Bois was more to his\n",
       "taste, for he could stretch his horse's legs; but every day he could be\n",
       "found before some simple cafe in Montparnasse, sipping vermouth, and\n",
       "watching the gay, light life about him.  He sat up with delight to see an\n",
       "artist and his \"Madame\" returning from a journey in the country, seated\n",
       "upon sheaves of corn, quite unregarded by the world; doing as they listed\n",
       "with unabashed simplicity.  He dined often at the little Hotel St. Malo\n",
       "near the Gare Montparnasse, where the excellent landlord played the host,\n",
       "father, critic, patron, comrade--often benefactor--to his bons enfants.\n",

       "poetry of a free, simple--even wild-life, but he had no instinct for vice\n",
       "in the name of amusement.  But the later hours spent in the garden under\n",
       "the stars, the cheerful hum of the boulevards coming to them distantly,\n",

       "\n",

       "incongruities.  Even Jacques, whose sense of humour had grown by long\n",

       "England, but of the North, of Canada, of Mexico, the Lotos Isles.  He did\n",
       "so picturesquely, yet simply too, in imperfect but sufficient French.\n",
       "But as he told of one striking incident in the Rockies, he heard Jacques\n",
       "make a quick expression of dissent.  He smiled.  He had made some mistake\n",
       "in detail.  Now, Jacques had been in his young days in Quebec the village\n",
       "story-teller; one who, by inheritance or competency, becomes semi-\n",
       "officially a raconteur for the parish; filling in winter evenings,\n",
       "nourishing summer afternoons, with tales, weird, childlike, daring.\n",

       "Presently he saw himself in a ridiculous picture: a buffalo dragging the\n",
       "Treasury Bench about the Chamber; as one conjures things in an absurd\n",
       "dream.  He laughed outright, at a moment when Mademoiselle Cerise was\n",
       "telling of a remarkable effect she produced one night in \"Fedora,\"\n",
       "unpremeditated, inspired; and Mademoiselle Cerise, with smiling lips and\n",
       "eyes like daggers, called him a bear.  This brought him to him self, and\n",
       "he swam with the enjoyment.  He did enjoy it, but not as his uncle wished\n",
       "and hoped.  Gaston did not respond eagerly to the charms of Mademoiselle\n",
       "Cerise and Madame Juliette.\n",
       "\n",
       "Was Delia, then, so strong in the barbarian's mind?  He could not think\n",
       "so, but Gaston had not shown yet, either for model, for daughter of joy,\n",
       "or for the mademoiselles of the stage any disposition to an amour or a\n",
       "misalliance; and either would be interesting and sufficient!  Models went\n",
       "in and out of Ian's studio and the studios of others, and Gaston chatted\n",
       "with them at times; and once he felt the bare arm and bare breast of a\n",
       "girl as she sat for a nymph, and said in an interested way that her flesh\n",
       "was as firm and fine as a Tongan's.  He even disputed with his uncle on\n",
       "the tints of her skin, on seeing him paint it in, showing a fine eye for\n",
       "colour.  But there was nothing more; he was impressed, observant,\n",
       "interested--that was all.  His uncle began to wonder if the Englishman\n",
       "was, after all, deeper in the grain than the savage.  He contented\n",
       "himself with the belief that the most vigorous natures are the most\n",
       "difficult to rouse.  Mademoiselle Cerise sang, with chic and abandon very\n",
       "fascinating to his own sensuous nature, a song with a charming air and\n",
       "sentiment.  It was after a night at the opera when they had seen her in\n",
       "\"Lucia,\" and the contrast, as she sang in his garden, softly lighted,\n",
       "showed her at the most attractive angles.  She drifted from a sparkling\n",
       "chanson to the delicate pathos of a song of De Musset's.\n",
       "\n",
       "Gaston responded to the artist; but to the woman--no.  He had seen a new\n",
       "life, even in its abandon, polite, fresh.  It amused him, but he could\n",
       "still turn to the remembrance of Delia without blushing, for he had come\n",
       "to this in the spirit of the idler, not the libertine.  Mademoiselle\n",
       "Cerise said to Ian at last:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Enfin, is the man stone?  As handsome as a leopard, too!  But, it is no\n",
       "matter.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She made another effort to interest him, however.  It galled her that he\n",
       "did not fall at her feet as others had done.  Even Ian had come there in\n",
       "his day, but she knew him too well.  She had said to him at the time:\n",
       "\"You, monsieur?  No, thank you.  A week, a month, and then the brute in\n",
       "you would out.  You make a woman fond, and then--a mat for your feet, and\n",
       "your wicked smile, and savage English words to drive her to the vitriol\n",
       "or the Seine.  Et puis, dear monsieur, accept my good friendship; nothing\n",
       "more.  I will sing to you, dance to you, even pray for you--we poor\n",
       "sinners do that sometimes, and go on sinning; but, again, nothing more.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Ian admired her all the more for her refusal of him, and they had been\n",
       "good friends.  He had told her of his nephew's coming, had hinted at his\n",
       "fortune, at his primitive soul, at the unconventional strain in him, even\n",
       "at marriage.  She could not read his purpose, but she knew there was\n",
       "something, and answering him with a yes, had waited.  Had Gaston have\n",
       "come to her feet she would probably have got at the truth somehow, and\n",
       "have worked in his favour--the joy vice takes to side with virtue, at\n",
       "times--when it is at no personal sacrifice.  But Gaston was superior in a\n",
       "grand way.  He was simple, courteous, interested only.  This stung her,\n",
       "and she would bring him to his knees, if she could.  This night she had\n",
       "rung all the changes, and had done no more than get his frank applause.\n",
       "She became petulant in an airy, exacting way.  She asked him about his\n",
       "horse.  This interested him.  She wanted to see it.  To-morrow?  No, no,\n",
       "now.  Perhaps to-morrow she would not care to; there was no joy in\n",
       "deliberate pleasure.  Now--now--now!  He laughed.  Well then, now, as she\n",

       "not take this into account--irreproachably clean.  The walls were covered\n",
       "with pictures; some taken for unpaid debts, gifts from students since\n",
       "risen to fame or gone into the outer darkness,--to young artists' eyes,\n",
       "the sordid moneymaking world,--and had there been lost; from a great\n",

       "had seen many little colonies of artists come and go.\n",
       "\n",
       "They sat down to the table, which was soon filled with students and\n",
       "artists.  Then Meyerbeer began to see, not only an interesting thing, but\n",
       "\"copy.\"  He was, in fact, preparing a certain article which, as he said\n",
       "to himself, would \"make 'em sit up\" in London and New York.  He had found\n",
       "out Gaston's history, had read his speech in the Commons, had seen\n",
       "paragraphs speculating as to where he was; and now he, Salem Meyerbeer,\n",
       "would tell them what the wild fellow was doing.  The Bullier, the cafes\n",
       "in the Latin Quarter, apartments in a humble street, dining for one-\n",
       "franc-fifty, supping with actresses, posing for the King of Ys with that\n",
       "actress in his arms--all excellent in their way.  But now there was\n",
       "needed an entanglement, intrigue, amour, and then America should shriek\n",
       "at his picture of one of the British aristocracy, and a gentleman of the\n",
       "Commons, \"on the loose,\" as he put it.\n",
       "\n",
       "He would head it:\n",
       "\n",
       "               \"ARISTOCRAT, POLITICIAN, LIBERTINE!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Then, under that he would put:\n",

       "               \"CAN THE ETHIOPIAN CHANGE HIS SKIN, OR THE\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Well, I think it's chic enough.  She's magnificent.  The colour of her\n",

       "\"I know enough.  The Comte Ploare visits her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How the devil does that concern my painting her?\"  There was iron in\n",

       "Desert,' at the Academy this year.  A fine thing: the leopard was free\n",
       "and strong.  As an Englishman, I am proud to meet you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The young Frenchman stared.  The quarrel had passed to a new and\n",
       "unexpected quarter.  Gaston's large, solid body, strong face, and\n",
       "penetrating eyes were not to be sneered out of sight.  The Frenchman,\n",
       "an envious, disappointed artist, had had in his mind a bloodless duel,\n",
       "to give a fillip to an unacquired fame.  He had, however, been drinking.\n",
       "He flung an insolent glance to meet Gaston's steady look, and said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The cock crows of his dunghill!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Gaston looked at the landlord, then got up calmly and walked down the\n",
       "table.  The Frenchman, expecting he knew not what, sprang to his feet,\n",
       "snatching up a knife; but Gaston was on him like a hawk, pinioning his\n",
       "arms and lifting him off the ground, binding his legs too, all so tight\n",
       "that the Frenchman squealed for breath.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Monsieur,\" said Gaston to the landlord, \"from the door or the window?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The landlord was pale.  It was in some respects a quarrel of races.\n",
       "For, French and English at the tables had got up and were eyeing each\n",
       "other.  As to the immediate outcome of the quarrel, there could be no\n",
       "doubt.  The English and Americans could break the others to pieces;\n",
       "but neither wished that.  The landlord decided the matter:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Drop him from this window.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He pushed a shutter back, and Gaston dropped the fellow on the hard\n",
       "pavement--a matter of five feet.  The Frenchman got up raging, and made\n",
       "for the door; but this time he was met by the landlord, who gave him his\n",
       "hat, and bade him come no more.  There was applause from both English and\n",
       "French.  The journalist chuckled--another column!\n",
       "\n",
       "Gaston had acted with coolness and common-sense; and when he sat down\n",
       "and began talking of the Englishman's picture again as if nothing had\n",
       "happened, the others followed, and the meal went on cheerfully.\n",
       "\n",
       "Presently another young English painter entered, and listened to the\n",
       "conversation, which Gaston brought back to Una and the lions.  It was his\n",
       "way to force things to his liking, if possible; and he wanted to hear\n",
       "about the woman--why, he did not ask himself.  The new arrival, Fancourt\n",
       "by name, kept looking at him quizzically.  Gaston presently said that he\n",
       "would visit the menagerie and see this famous dompteuse that afternoon.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She's a brick,\" said Bagshot.  \"I was in debt, a year behind with my\n",
       "Pelletier here, and it took all I got for 'A Passion in the Desert' to\n",
       "square up.  I'd nothing to go on with.  I spent my last sou in visiting\n",
       "the menagerie.  There I got an idea.  I went to her, told her how I was\n",
       "fixed, and begged her to give me a chance.  By Jingo!  she brought the\n",
       "water to my eyes.  Some think she's a bit of a devil; but she can be a\n",
       "devil of a saint, that's all I've got to say.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Zoug-Zoug's responsible for the devil,\" said Fancourt to Bagshot.\n",

       "\"Shut up, Fan,\" rejoined Bagshot, hurriedly, and then whispered to him\n",
       "quickly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fancourt sent self-conscious glances down the table towards Gaston; and\n",
       "then a young American, newly come to Paris, said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who's Zoug-Zoug, and what's Zoug-Zoug?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It's milk for babes, youngster,\" answered Bagshot quickly, and changed\n",
       "the conversation.\n",
       "\n",
       "Gaston saw something strange in the little incident; but he presently\n",
       "forgot it for many a day, and then remembered it for many a day, when the\n",
       "wheel had spun through a wild arc.\n",
       "\n",
       "When they rose from the table, Meyerbeer went to Bagshot, and said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Say, who's Zoug-Zoug, anyway?\" Bagshot coolly replied:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I'm acting for another paper.  What price?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Fifty dollars,\" in a low voice, eagerly.  Bagshot meditated.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"H'm, fifty dollars!  Two hundred and fifty francs, or thereabouts.\n",
       "Beggarly!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A hundred, then.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Bagshot got to his feet, lighting a cigarette.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Want to have a pretty story against a woman, and to smutch a man, do\n",
       "you?  Well, I'm hard up; I don't mind gossip among ourselves; but sell\n",
       "the stuff to you--I'll see you damned first!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This was said sufficiently loud; and after that, Meyerbeer could not ask\n",
       "Fancourt, so he departed with Gaston, who courteously dismissed him, to\n",
       "his astonishment and regret, for he had determined to visit the menagerie\n",
       "with his quarry.\n",
       "\n",
       "Gaston went to his apartments, and cheerily summoned Jacques.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Now, little man, for a holiday!  The menagerie: lions, leopards, and a\n",
       "grand dompteuse; and afterwards dinner with me at the Cafe Blanche.  I\n",
       "want a blow-out of lions and that sort.  I'd like to be a lion-tamer\n",
       "myself for a month, or as long as might be.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He caught Jacques by the shoulders--he had not done so since that\n",
       "memorable day at Ridley Court.  \"See, Jacques, we'll do this every year.\n",
       "Six months in England, and three months on the Continent,--in your\n",
       "France, if you like,--and three months in the out-of-the-wayest place,\n",
       "where there'll be big game.  Hidalgos for six months, Goths for the\n",
       "rest.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "A half-hour later they were in the menagerie.  They sat near the\n",
       "doors where the performers entered.  For a long time they watched the\n",
       "performance with delight, clapping and calling bravo like boys.\n",
       "Presently the famous dompteuse entered,--Mademoiselle Victorine,--passing\n",
       "just below Gaston.  He looked down, interested, at the supple, lithe\n",
       "creature making for the cages of lions in the amphitheatre.  The figure\n",
       "struck him as familiar.  Presently the girl turned, throwing a glance\n",
       "round the theatre.  He caught the dash of the dark, piercing eyes, the\n",
       "luminous look, the face unpainted--in its own natural colour: neither hot\n",
       "health nor paleness, but a thing to bear the light of day.  \"Andree the\n",
       "gipsy!\" he exclaimed in a low tone.\n",
       "\n",
       "In less than two years this!  Here was fame.  A wanderer, an Ishmael\n",
       "then, her handful of household goods and her father in the grasp of the\n",
       "Law: to-day, Mademoiselle Victorine, queen of animal-tamers!  And her\n",
       "name associated with the Comte Ploare!\n",
       "\n",
       "With the Comte Ploare?  Had it come to that?  He remembered the look in\n",
       "her face when he bade her good-bye.  Impossible!  Then, immediately he\n",
       "laughed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Why impossible?  And why should he bother his head about it?  People of\n",
       "this sort: Mademoiselle Cerise, Madame Juliette, Mademoiselle Victorine--\n",
       "what were they to him, or to themselves?\n",
       "\n",
       "There flashed through his brain three pictures: when he stood by the\n",
       "bedside of the old dying Esquimaux in Labrador, and took a girl's hand in\n",
       "his; when among the flowers at Peppingham he heard Delia say: \"Oh,\n",
       "Gaston!  Gaston!\" and Alice's face at midnight in the moonlit window at\n",
       "Ridley Court.\n",
       "\n",
       "How strange this figure--spangled, gaudy, standing among her lions--\n",
       "seemed by these.  To think of her, his veins thumping thus, was an insult\n",
       "to all three: to Delia, one unpardonable.  And yet he could not take his\n",
       "eyes off her.  Her performance was splendid.  He was interested,\n",
       "speculative.  She certainly had flown high; for, again, why should not a\n",
       "dompteuse be a decent woman?  And here were money, fame of a kind, and an\n",
       "occupation that sent his blood bounding.  A dompteur!  He had tamed\n",
       "moose, and young mountain lions, and a catamount, and had had mad hours\n",
       "with pumas and arctic bears; and he could understand how even he might\n",
       "easily pass from M.P. to dompteur.  It was not intellectual, but it was\n",
       "power of a kind; and it was decent, and healthy, and infinitely better\n",
       "than playing the Jew in business, or keeping a tavern, or \"shaving\"\n",
       "notes, and all that.  Truly, the woman was to be admired, for she was\n",
       "earning an honest living; and no doubt they lied when they named her with\n",
       "Count Ploare.  He kept coming back to that--Count Ploare!  Why could they\n",
       "not leave these women alone?  Did they think none of them virtuous?  He\n",
       "would stake his life that Andree--he would call her that--was as straight\n",
       "as the sun.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What do you think of her, Jacques?\" he said suddenly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is grand.  Mon Dieu, she is wonderful--and a face all fire!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Presently she came out of the cage, followed by two great lions.  She\n",
       "walked round the ring, a hand on the head of each: one growling, the\n",
       "other purring against her, with a ponderous kind of affection.  She\n",
       "talked to them as they went, giving occasionally a deep purring sound\n",
       "like their own.  Her talk never ceased.  She looked at the audience, but\n",
       "only as in a dream.  Her mind was all with the animals.  There was\n",
       "something splendid in it: she, herself, was a noble animal; and she\n",
       "seemed entirely in place where she was.  The lions were fond of her, and\n",
       "she of them; but the first part of her performance had shown that they\n",
       "could be capricious.  A lion's love is but a lion's love after all--and\n",
       "hers likewise, no doubt!  The three seemed as one in their beauty, the\n",
       "woman superbly superior.  Meyerbeer, in a far corner, was still on the\n",
       "trail of his sensation.  He thought that he might get an article out of\n",
       "it--with the help of Count Ploare and Zoug-Zoug.  Who was Zoug-Zoug?\n",
       "He exulted in her picturesqueness, and he determined to lie in wait.  He\n",
       "thought it a pity that Comte Ploare was not an Englishman or an American;\n",
       "but it couldn't be helped.  Yes, she was, as he said to himself, \"a\n",
       "stunner.\"  Meanwhile he watched Gaston, noted his intense interest.\n",
       "\n",
       "Presently the girl stopped beside the cage.  A chariot was brought out,\n",
       "and the two lions were harnessed to it.  Then she called out another\n",
       "larger lion, which came unwillingly at first.  She spoke sharply, and\n",
       "then struck him.  He growled, but came on.  Then she spoke softly to him,\n",
       "and made that peculiar purr, soft and rich.  Now he responded, walked\n",
       "round her, coming closer, till his body made a half-circle about her, and\n",
       "his head was at her knees.  She dropped her hand on it.  Great applause\n",
       "rang through the building.  This play had been quite accidental.  But\n",
       "there lay one secret of the girl's success.  She was original; she\n",
       "depended greatly on the power of the moment for her best effects, and\n",
       "they came at unexpected times.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was at this instant that, glancing round the theatre in acknowledgment\n",
       "of the applause, her eyes rested mechanically on Gaston's box.  There was\n",
       "generally some one important in that box: from a foreign prince to a\n",
       "young gentleman whose proudest moment was to take off his hat in the Bois\n",
       "to the queen of a lawless court.  She had tired of being introduced to\n",
       "princes.  What could it mean to her?  And for the young bloods, whose\n",
       "greatest regret was that they could not send forth a daughter of joy into\n",
       "the Champs Elysee in her carriage, she had ever sent them about their\n",
       "business.  She had no corner of pardon for them.  She kissed her lions,\n",
       "she hugged the lion's cub that rode back and forth with her to the\n",
       "menagerie day by day--her companion in her modest apartments; but sell\n",
       "one of these kisses to a young gentleman of Paris, whose ambition was to\n",
       "master all the vices, and then let the vices master him!--she had not\n",
       "come to that, though, as she said in some bitter moments, she had come\n",
       "far.\n",
       "\n",
       "Count Ploare--there was nothing in that.  A blase man of the world, who\n",
       "had found it all not worth the bothering about, neither code nor people--\n",
       "he saw in this rich impetuous nature a new range of emotions, a brief\n",
       "return to the time when he tasted an open strong life in Algiers, in\n",
       "Tahiti.  And he would laugh at the world by marrying her--yes, actually\n",
       "marrying her, the dompteuse!  Accident had let him render her a service,\n",
       "not unimportant, once at Versailles, and he had been so courteous and\n",
       "considerate afterwards, that she had let him see her occasionally, but\n",
       "never yet alone.  He soon saw that an amour was impossible.  At last he\n",
       "spoke of marriage.  She shook her head.  She ought to have been grateful,\n",
       "but she was not.  Why should she be?  She did not know why he wished to\n",
       "marry her; but, whatever the reason, he was selfish.  Well, she would be\n",
       "selfish.  She did not care for him.  If she married him, it would be\n",
       "because she was selfish: because of position, ease; for protection in\n",
       "this shameless Paris; and for a home, she who had been a wanderer since\n",
       "her birth.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was mere bargaining.  But at last her free, independent nature\n",
       "revolted.  No: she had had enough of the chain, and the loveless hand of\n",
       "man, for three months that were burned into her brain--no more!  If ever\n",
       "she loved--all; but not the right for Count Ploare to demand the\n",
       "affection she gave her lions freely.\n",
       "\n",
       "The manager of the menagerie had tried for her affections, had offered a\n",
       "price for her friendship; and failing, had become as good a friend as\n",
       "such a man could be.  She even visited his wife occasionally, and gave\n",
       "gifts to his children; and the mother trusted her and told her her\n",
       "trials.  And so the thing went on, and the people talked.\n",
       "\n",
       "As we said, she turned her eyes to Gaston's box.  Instantly they became\n",
       "riveted, and then a deep flush swept slowly up her face and burned into\n",
       "her splendid hair.  Meyerbeer was watching through his opera-glasses.\n",
       "He gave an exclamation of delight:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"By the holy smoke, here's something!\" he said aloud.\n",
       "\n",
       "For an instant Gaston and the girl looked at each other intently.  He\n",
       "made a slight sign of recognition with his hand, and then she turned\n",
       "away, gone a little pale now.  She stood looking at her lions, as if\n",
       "trying to recollect herself.  The lion at her feet helped her.  He had\n",
       "a change of temper, and, possibly fretting under inaction, growled.  At\n",
       "once she summoned him to get into the chariot.  He hesitated, but did so.\n",
       "She put the reins in his paws and took her place behind.  Then a robe of\n",
       "purple and ermine was thrown over her shoulders by an attendant; she gave\n",
       "a sharp command, and the lions came round the ring, to wild applause.\n",
       "Even a Parisian audience had never seen anything like this.  It was\n",
       "amusing too; for the coachman-lion was evidently disgusted with his task,\n",
       "and growled in a helpless kind of way.\n",
       "\n",
       "As they passed Gaston's box, they were very near.  The girl threw one\n",
       "swift glance; but her face was well controlled now.  She heard, however,\n",
       "a whispered word come to her:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Andree!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "A few moments afterwards she retired, and the performance was in other\n",
       "and less remarkable hands.  Presently the manager himself came, and said\n",
       "that Mademoiselle Victorine would be glad to see Monsieur Belward if he\n",
       "so wished.  Gaston left Jacques, and went.\n",
       "\n",
       "Meyerbeer noticed the move, and determined to see the meeting if\n",
       "possible.  There was something in it, he was sure.  He would invent an\n",
       "excuse, and make his way behind.\n",
       "\n",
       "Gaston and the manager were in the latter's rooms waiting for Victorine.\n",
       "Presently a messenger came, saying that Monsieur Belward would find\n",
       "Mademoiselle in her dressing-room.  Thither Gaston went, accompanied by\n",
       "the manager, who, however, left him at the door, nodding good-naturedly\n",
       "to Victorine, and inwardly praying that here was no danger to his\n",
       "business, for Victorine was a source of great profit.  Yet he had failed\n",
       "himself, and all others had failed in winning her--why should this man\n",
       "succeed, if that was his purpose?\n",
       "\n",
       "There was present an elderly, dark-featured Frenchwoman, who was always\n",
       "with Victorine, vigilant, protective, loving her as her own daughter.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Monsieur!\" said Andree, a warm colour in her cheek.  Gaston shook her\n",
       "hand cordially, and laughed.  \"Mademoiselle--Andree?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He looked inquiringly.  \"Yes, to you,\" she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have it all your own way now--isn't it so?\"  \"With the lions, yes.\n",
       "Please sit down.  This is my dear keeper,\" she said, touching the woman's\n",
       "shoulder.  Then, to the woman: \"Annette, you have heard me speak of this\n",
       "gentleman?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The woman nodded, and modestly touched Gaston's outstretched hand.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Monsieur was kind once to my dear Mademoiselle,\" she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "Gaston cheerily smiled:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nothing, nothing, upon my word!\"  Presently he continued:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Your father, what of him?\"  She sighed and shivered a little.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He died in Auvergne three months after you saw him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And you?\"  He waved a hand towards the menagerie.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is a long story,\" she answered, not meeting his eyes.  \"I hated the\n",
       "Romany life.  I became an artist's model; sickened of that,\"--her voice\n",
       "went quickly here, \"joined a travelling menagerie, and became what I am.\n",
       "That in brief.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have done well,\" he said admiringly, his face glowing.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am a successful dompteuse,\" she replied.\n",
       "\n",
       "She then asked him who was his companion in the box.  He told her.\n",
       "She insisted on sending for Jacques.  Meanwhile they talked of her\n",
       "profession, of the animals.  She grew eloquent.  Jacques arrived, and\n",
       "suddenly remembered Andree--stammered, was put at his ease, and dropped\n",
       "into talk with Annette.  Gaston fell into reminiscences of wild game, and\n",
       "talked intelligently, acutely of her work.  He must wait, she said, until\n",
       "the performance closed, and then she would show him the animals as a\n",
       "happy family.  Thus a half-hour went by.\n",
       "\n",
       "Meanwhile, Meyerbeer had asked the manager to take him to Mademoiselle;\n",
       "but was told that Victorine never gave information to journalists, and\n",
       "would not be interviewed.  Besides, she had a visitor.  Yes, Meyerbeer\n",
       "knew it--Mr. Gaston Belward; but that did not matter.  The manager\n",
       "thought it did matter.  Then, with an idea of the future, Meyerbeer asked\n",
       "to be shown the menagerie thoroughly--he would write it up for England\n",
       "and America.\n",
       "\n",
       "And so it happened that there were two sets of people inspecting the\n",
       "menagerie after the performance.  Andree let a dozen of the animals out--\n",
       "lions, leopards, a tiger, and a bear,--and they gambolled round her\n",
       "playfully, sometimes quarrelling with each other, but brought up smartly\n",
       "by her voice and a little whip, which she always carried--the only sign\n",
       "of professional life about her, though there was ever a dagger hid in her\n",
       "dress.  For the rest, she looked a splendid gipsy.\n",
       "\n",
       "Gaston suddenly asked if he might visit her.  At the moment she was\n",
       "playing with the young tiger.  She paused, was silent, preoccupied.  The\n",
       "tiger, feeling neglected, caught her hand with its paw, tearing the skin.\n",
       "Gaston whipped out his handkerchief, and stanched the blood.  She wrapped\n",
       "the handkerchief quickly round her hand, and then, recovering herself,\n",
       "ordered the animals back into their cages.  They trotted away, and the\n",
       "attendant locked them up.  Meanwhile Jacques had picked up and handed to\n",
       "Gaston a letter, dropped when he drew out his handkerchief.  It was one\n",
       "received two days before from Delia Gasgoyne.  He had a pang of\n",
       "confusion, and hastily put it into his pocket.\n",
       "\n",
       "Up to this time there had been no confusion in his mind.  He was going\n",
       "back to do his duty; to marry the girl, union with whom would be an\n",
       "honour; to take his place in his kingdom.  He had had no minute's doubt\n",
       "of that.  It was necessary, and it should be done.  The girl?  Did he not\n",
       "admire her, honour her, care for her?  Why, then, this confusion?\n",
       "\n",
       "Andree said to him that he might come the next morning for breakfast.\n",
       "She said it just as the manager and Meyerbeer passed her.  Meyerbeer\n",
       "heard it, and saw the look in the faces of both: in hers, bewildered,\n",
       "warm, penetrating; in Gaston's, eager, glowing, bold, with a distant kind\n",
       "of trouble.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here was a thickening plot for Paul Pry.  He hugged himself.  But who was\n",
       "Zoug-Zoug?  If he could but get at that!  He asked the manager, who said\n",
       "he did not know.  He asked a dozen men that evening, but none knew.  He\n",
       "would ask Ian Belward.  What a fool not to have thought of him at first.\n",
       "He knew all the gossip of Paris, and was always communicative--but was\n",
       "he, after all?  He remembered now that the painter had a way of talking\n",
       "at discretion: he had never got any really good material from him.  But\n",
       "he would try him in this.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, as Gaston and Jacques travelled down the Boulevard Montparnasse,\n",
       "Meyerbeer was not far behind.  The journalist found Ian Belward at home,\n",
       "in a cynical indolent mood.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Wherefore Meyerbeer?\" he said, as he motioned the other to a chair, and\n",
       "pushed over vermouth and cigarettes.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To ask a question.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"One question?  Come, that's penance.  Aren't you lying as usual?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No; one only.  I've got the rest of it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Got the rest of it, eh?  Nasty mess you've got, whatever it is, I'll be\n",
       "bound.  What a nice mob you press fellows are--wholesale scavengers!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That's all right.  This vermouth is good enough.  Well, will you answer\n",
       "my question?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Possibly, if it's not personal.  But Lord knows where your insolence may\n",
       "run!  You may ask if I'll introduce you to a decent London club!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Meyerbeer flushed at last.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You're rubbing it in,\" he said angrily.\n",
       "\n",
       "He did wish to be introduced to a good London club.  \"The question isn't\n",
       "personal, I guess.  It's this: Who's Zoug-Zoug?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Smoke had come trailing out of Belward's nose, his head thrown back, his\n",
       "eyes on the ceiling.  It stopped, and came out of his mouth on one long,\n",
       "straight whiff.  Then the painter brought his head to a natural position\n",
       "slowly, and looking with a furtive nonchalance at Meyerbeer, said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who is what?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who's Zoug-Zoug?\"\n",

       "\n",

       "\"Yes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The woman is Mademoiselle Victorine, the dompteuse.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "straight: no lies: who are the others?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Meyerbeer hesitated; for, of course, he did not wish to speak of Gaston\n",
       "at this stage in the game.  But he said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Count Ploare--and Zoug-Zoug.\"\n",

       "\n",
       "\"That's all.  And see, scavenger, take my advice and let Zoug-Zoug alone.\n",
       "He's a man of influence; and he's possessed of a devil.  He'll make you\n",
       "sorry, if you meddle with him!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He rose, and Meyerbeer did the same, saying: \"You'd better tell me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Now, don't bother me.  Drink your vermouth, take that bundle of\n",
       "cigarettes, and hunt Zoug-Zoug else where.  If you find him, let me know.\n",
       "Good-bye.\"\n",

       "\n",

       "emotionally affectionate, interesting, uncommon.  He had a knack of\n",
       "saying as much in one page as most people did in five.  Her imagination\n",
       "was not great, but he stimulated it.  If he wrote a pungent line on\n",
       "Daudet or Whistler, on Montaigne or Fielding, she was stimulated to know\n",

       "the son of a half-heathen.\n",
       "\n",
       "He interested her all the more.  Her letters were hardly so fascinating\n",

       "that that something was Delia Gasgoyne.  He did not.  Perhaps because it\n",

       "he said to himself, he would soon go to join the yacht at Gibraltar, and\n",
       "all this would be over-over.  All this?  All what?  A gipsy, a dompteuse\n",
       "--what was she to him?  She interested him, he liked her, and she liked\n",
       "him, but there had been nothing more between them.  Near as he was to her\n",

       "\n",
       "She, too, had continually said to herself that this man could be nothing\n",

       "was different--he had befriended her father.  She had not singular\n",

       "with great force.\n",
       "\n",
       "Gasgoyne put the helm hard down, but she would not obey.  He tried at\n",
       "once to get in his sails, but the surf was running very strong, and\n",

       "to dip under the yacht's stern, but he found himself drifting alongside,\n",
       "and in danger of dashing broadside on her.  He got an oar and backed with\n",
       "all his strength towards the stern, the anchor holding well.  Then he\n",
       "called to those on board to be ready to jump.  Once in line with the\n",

       "her first instinct.  But then, life was sweet.  Besides, she had to think\n",
       "of others.  Her father, too, was chiefly concerned for her safety and for\n",

       "came.  The boat swayed as the others leaped, and he held her close\n",
       "meanwhile.  Her eyes closed, she shuddered and went white.  When he put\n",

       "\n",
       "\"She is known in Audierne as Madame Belward.\"  The girl started.  Her\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Mr. Gasgoyne could not think that all had necessarily ended.  The thing\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Let us say nothing more,\" said Gaston, choking down wrath at the\n",

       "and little children, filing up from the village and the sea, singing as\n",
       "they came.  He drew up to the wall, stood upon the stone seat, and took\n",
       "off his hat while the procession passed.  He had met the cure, first\n",
       "accidentally on the shore, and afterwards in the cure's house, finding\n",
       "much in common--he had known many priests in the North, known much good\n",
       "of them.  The cure glanced up at him now as they passed, and a half-sad\n",
       "smile crossed his face.  Gaston caught it as it passed.  The cure read\n",
       "his case truly enough and gently enough too.  In some wise hour he would\n",
       "plead with Gaston for the woman's soul and his own.\n",
       "\n",
       "Gaston did not find Andree at the chateau.  She had gone out alone\n",
       "towards the sea, Annette said, by a route at the rear of the village.\n",
       "He went also, but did not find her.  As he came again to the quay he saw\n",
       "the Kismet beating upon the rocks--the sailors had given up any idea of\n",
       "saving her.  He stood and watched the sea breaking over her, and the\n",
       "whole scene flashed back on him.  He thought how easily he could be\n",
       "sentimental over the thing.  But that was not his nature.  He had made\n",
       "his bed, but he would not lie in it--he would carry it on his back.\n",
       "They all said that he had gone on the rocks.  He laughed.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I can turn that tide: I can make things come my way,\" he said.  \"All\n",
       "they want is sensation, it isn't morals that concerns them.  Well, IT\n",
       "give them sensation.  They expect me to hide, and drop out of the game.\n",
       "Never--so help me Heaven!  I'll play it so they'll forget this!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He rolled and lighted a cigarette, and went again to the chateau.  Dinner\n",
       "was ready--had been ready for some time.  He sat down, and presently\n",
       "Andree came.  There was a look in her face that he could not understand.\n",
       "They ate their dinner quietly, not mentioning the events of the\n",
       "afternoon.\n",
       "\n",
       "Presently a telegram was brought to him.  It read: \"Come.  My office,\n",
       "Downing Street, Friday.  Expect you.\"  It was signed \"Faramond.\"  At the\n",
       "same time came letters: from his grandfather, from Captain Maudsley.  The\n",
       "first was stern, imperious, reproachful.--Shame for those that took him\n",
       "in and made him, a ruined reputation, a spoiled tradition: he had been\n",
       "but a heathen after all!  There was only left to bid him farewell,\n",
       "and to enclose a cheque for two thousand pounds.\n",
       "\n",
       "Captain Maudsley called him a fool, and asked him what he meant to do\n",
       "--hoped he would give up the woman at once, and come back.  He owed\n",

       "oughtn't to be messed about.\n",
       "\n",
       "There it all was: not a word about radical morality or immorality; but\n",
       "the tradition of Family, the Commons, Master of the Hounds!\n",
       "\n",
       "But there was another letter.  He did not recognise the handwriting, and\n",
       "the envelope had a black edge.  He turned it over and over, forgetting\n",
       "that Andree was watching him.  Looking up, he caught her eyes, with their\n",
       "strange, sad look.  She guessed what was in these letters.  She knew\n",
       "English well enough to under stand them.  He interpreted her look, and\n",

       "\n",
       "     If you were not in deep trouble I would not write.  But because I\n",

       "\n",
       "In a few moments he came to her.  She was sitting upright in a chair,\n",

       "he was leaving, Gaston and he recognised each other.  The lad's greeting\n",
       "was a little shy until he saw that Gaston was cool and composed as usual\n",

       "\n",
       "\"And Lady Dargan, Cluny?\" asked Gaston quietly.  Cluny could not be\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Well, she was a bit fierce at first--she's a woman, you know; but\n",
       "afterwards she went like a baby; cried, and wouldn't stay at Cannes any\n",

       "\"Do you think I had better call, Cluny?\" Gaston ventured suggestively.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, yes, of course,\" Cluny replied, with great eagerness, as if to\n",
       "justify the matter to himself.  Gaston smiled, said that he might,--\n",

       "\"Yes, I'm 'going to cut in,' Cluny boy.\"  Cluny brightened.\n",

       "general flavour of reproach.  The tradition of the Commons!  Ah, one way\n",
       "only: he must come back alone--alone--and live it down.  Fortunately, it\n",
       "wasn't an intrigue--no matter of divorce--a dompteuse, he believed.  It\n",
       "must end, of course, and he would see what could be done.  Such a chance\n",
       "--such a chance as he had had!  Make it up with his grandfather, and\n",
       "reverse the record--reverse the record: that was the only way.  This\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",

       "Gaston did not wince, he had expected it.  He owed these old people\n",
       "something.  They lived according to their lights, they had acted\n",
       "righteously as by their code, they had used him well--well always.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Will you hear the whole story?\" he said.  He felt that it would be best\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I remember very well,\" Sir William said, with painful meditation: \"a\n",

       "Ah, yes, an unhappy case!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There is more?\" asked Lady Belward, leaning on her cane.  She seemed\n",

       "\n",
       "Then with a terrible brevity Gaston told them of his uncle, of the letter\n",

       "\"Impossible!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I promised, and I will go back.\"  Lady Belward's voice quivered:\n",

       "Then in a few words he thanked them for all, and bade them good-bye.  He\n",

       "\n",
       "She did not reply.  He turned to his grandfather.  \"There is no other\n",
       "way,\" said the old man, sternly.  Then in a voice almost shrill with pain\n",
       "and indignation, he cried out as he had never done in his life: \"Nothing,\n",
       "nothing, nothing but disgrace!  My God in heaven!  a lion-tamer--a gipsy!\n",
       "An honourable name dragged through the mire!  Go back,\" he said grandly;\n",
       "\"go back to the woman and her lions--savages, savages, savages!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Savages after the manner of our forefathers,\" Gaston answered quietly.\n",

       "\n",
       "Lady Belward's face was in her hands.  \"Good-bye-grandmother,\" he said at\n",

       "\n",
       "At the outer door the old housekeeper stepped forward, her gloomy face\n",

       "\n",
       "In the library Sir William and Lady Belward sat silent for a time.\n",
       "Presently Sir William rose, and walked up and down.  He paused at last,\n",
       "and said, in a strange, hesitating voice, his hands chafing each other:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I forgot myself, my dear.  I fear I was violent.  I would like to ask\n",
       "his pardon.  Ah, yes, yes!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Then he sat down and took her hand, and held it long in the silence.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It all feels so empty--so empty,\" she said at last, as the tower-clock\n",
       "struck hollow on the air.\n",
       "\n",
       "The old man could not reply, but he drew her close to him, and Hovey,\n",

       "\n",
       "Gaston went to Manchester Square.  He half dreaded a meeting with Alice,\n",
       "and yet he wished it.  He did not find her.  She had gone to Paris with\n",
       "her uncle, the servant said.  He got their address.  There was little\n",
       "left to do but to avoid reporters, two of whom almost forced themselves\n",
       "in upon him.  He was to go back to Douarnenez by the little boat that\n",
       "brought him, and at seven o'clock in the morning he watched the mists of\n",
       "England recede.\n",
       "\n",
       "He chanced to put his hand into a light overcoat which he had got at his\n",
       "chambers before he started.  He drew out a paper, the one discovered in\n",
       "the solicitor's office in London.  It was an ancient deed of entail of\n",
       "the property, drawn by Sir Gaston Belward, which, through being lost,\n",
       "was never put into force.  He was not sure that it had value.  If it had,\n",
       "all chance of the estate was gone for him; it would be his uncle's.\n",
       "Well, what did it matter?  Yes, it did matter: Andree!  For her?  No, not\n",
       "for her.  He would play straight.  He would take his future as it came:\n",
       "he would not drop this paper into the water.\n",
       "\n",
       "He smiled bitterly, got an envelope at a publichouse on the quay, wrote a\n",
       "few words in pencil on the document, and in a few moments it was on its\n",
       "way to Sir William Belward, who when he received it said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Worthless, quite worthless, but he has an honest mind--an honest mind!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Meanwhile, Andree was in Paris.  Leaving her bag at the Gare\n",
       "Montparnasse, she had gone straight to Ian Belward's house.  She had\n",
       "lived years in the last few hours.  She had had no sleep on the journey,\n",
       "and her mind had been strained unbearably.  It had, however, a fixed\n",
       "idea, which shuttled in and out in a hundred shapes, but ever pointing to\n",
       "one end.  She had determined on a painful thing--the only way.\n",
       "\n",
       "She reached the house, and was admitted.  In answer to questions, she had\n",
       "an appointment with monsieur.  He was not within.  Well, she would wait.\n",
       "She was motioned into the studio.  She was outwardly calm.  The servant\n",
       "presently recognised her.  He had been to the menagerie, and he had seen\n",
       "her with Gaston.  His manner changed instantly.  Could he do anything?\n",
       "No, nothing.  She was left alone.  For a long time she sat motionless,\n",
       "then a sudden restlessness seized her.  Her brain seemed a burning\n",
       "atmosphere, in which every thought, every thing showed with an unbearable\n",
       "intensity.  The terrible clearness of it all--how it made her eyes, her\n",
       "heart ache!  Her blood was beating hard against every pore.  She felt\n",
       "that she would go mad if he did not come.  Once she took out the stiletto\n",
       "she had concealed in the bosom of her cloak, and looked at it.  She had\n",
       "always carried it when among the beasts at the menagerie, but had never\n",
       "yet used it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Time passed.  She felt ill; she became blind with pain.  Presently the\n",
       "servant entered with a telegram.  His master would not be back until the\n",
       "next morning.\n",
       "\n",
       "Very well, she would return in the morning.  She gave him money.  He was\n",
       "not to say that she had called.  In the Boulevard Montparnasse she took a\n",
       "cab.  To the menagerie, she said to the driver.  How strange it all\n",
       "looked: the Invalides, Notre Dame, the Tuileries Gardens, the Place de la\n",
       "Concorde!  The innumerable lights were so near and yet so far: it was a\n",
       "kink of the brain, but she seemed withdrawn from them, not they from her.\n",
       "A woman passed with a baby in her arms.  The light from a kiosk fell on\n",
       "it as she passed.  What a pretty, sweet face it had.  Why did it not have\n",
       "a pretty, delicate Breton cap?  As she went on, that kept beating in her\n",
       "brain--why did not the child wear a dainty Breton cap--a white Breton\n",
       "cap?  The face kept peeping from behind the lights--without the dainty\n",
       "Breton cap.\n",
       "\n",
       "The menagerie at last.  She dismissed the cab, went to a little door at\n",
       "the back of the building, and knocked.  She was admitted.  The care-taker\n",
       "exclaimed with pleasure.  She wished to visit the animals?  He would go\n",
       "with her; and he picked up a light.  No, she would go alone.  How were\n",
       "Hector and Balzac, and Antoinette?  She took the keys.  How cool and\n",
       "pleasant they were to the touch!  The steel of the lantern too--how\n",
       "exquisitely soothing!  He must lie down again: she would wake him as she\n",
       "came out.  No, no, she would go alone.\n",
       "\n",
       "She went to cage after cage.  At last to that of the largest lions.\n",
       "There was a deep answering purr to her soft call.  As she entered, she\n",
       "saw a heap moving in one corner--a lion lately bought.  She spoke, and\n",
       "there was an angry growl.  She wheeled to leave the cage, but her cloak\n",
       "caught the door, and it snapped shut.\n",
       "\n",
       "Too late.  A blow brought her to the ground.  She had made no cry, and\n",
       "now she lay so still!\n",

       "The watchman had fallen asleep again.  In the early morning he\n",

Begin with an early morning start and a focus on professional duties, specifically a significant discussion or debate at work. Include a midday meal shared with an acquaintance, where the narrator feigns camaraderie despite underlying tension. Describe an afternoon outing to a theatrical performance, noting the playâ€™s charm and the narratorâ€™s justification for attending despite personal principles. Mention a tragic event involving a prominent actor, emphasizing the brutality of the incident and its impact on the theater community. Conclude with a brief social visit where news of an upcoming noble title is shared, followed by a return to work and a quiet evening at home. Use complex, slightly archaic sentence structures and a refined vocabulary to evoke a historical, literary feel. Maintain a measured tone, blending personal reflection with external observations, and ensure the paragraph flows naturally as a cohesive narrative of the dayâ€™s events."

The paragraph should describe a unique cultural or legal custom that commands immediate attention and obedience from a community. Highlight the dramatic effect of this custom, emphasizing how it interrupts daily life across various professions and activities. Use elevated, slightly archaic language to convey the weight and antiquity of the tradition, and include references to historical figures or institutions that legitimize its practice. The sentences should be complex and varied, with a mix of longer, descriptive clauses and shorter, impactful statements. Incorporate vivid imagery to illustrate the sudden halt in routine tasks, such as work, education, and leisure, as the community collectively responds to the call. Ensure the paragraph conveys a sense of continuity between past and present, suggesting that this custom remains a powerful and binding force in the community. Aim for a length of 6-8 sentences, maintaining a balance between detail and flow."

       "the child, with the wild belief that through it he could reach Guida,\n",
       "could bring her to him.  For now this woman who despised him, hated him,\n",
       "he desired more than all else in the world.  Ambition has her own means\n",
       "of punishing.  For her gifts of place or fortune she puts some impossible\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Your law of Haro, monsieur le Bailly!\" Guida answered with flashing\n",
       "eyes, her voice ringing out fearlessly.  \"Your law of Haro!  The law of\n",
       "Haro comes from the custom of Normandy, which is the law of Jersey.  You\n",
       "make its intent this, you make it that, but nothing can alter the law,\n",
       "and what has been done in its name for generations.  Is it so, that if\n",
       "Philip d'Avranche trespass on my land, or my hearth, I may cry Haro,\n",
       "haro!  and you will take heed?  But when it is blood of my blood, bone of\n",

       "Messieurs, it is the justice of Haro that I ask, not your lax usage of\n",
       "it.  From this Prince Philip I appeal to the spirit of Prince Rollo who\n",
       "made this law.  I appeal to the law of Jersey which is the Custom of\n",
       "Normandy.  There are precedents enough, as you well know, messieurs.  I\n",
       "demand--I demand--my child.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The Bailly and the jurats were in a hopeless quandary.  They glanced\n",

       "were timorous of deciding against the Prince.\n",
       "\n",
       "She saw their hesitation.  \"I call on you to fulfil the law.  I have\n",

       "duke of Europe.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The Bailly and the jurats were overwhelmed by the situation.  Guida's\n",
       "brain was a hundred times clearer than theirs.  Danger, peril to her\n",

       "daring, the desperation of the lioness fighting for her own.\n",
       "\n",
       "Philip himself solved the problem.  Turning to the bench of jurats, he\n",

       "\n",
       "\"She is quite right; the law of Haro is with her.  It must apply.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The Court was in a greater maze than ever.  Was he then about to restore\n",

       "\"But in this case there was no trespass, for the child--is my own.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Every eye in the Cohue Royale fixed itself upon him, then upon Guida,\n",
       "then upon her who was known as the Duchesse de Bercy.  The face of the\n",
       "Comtesse Chantavoine was like snow, white and cold.  As the words were\n",
       "spoken a sigh broke from her, and there came to Philip's mind that\n",
       "distant day in the council chamber at Bercy when for one moment he was\n",
       "upon his trial; but he did not turn and look at her now.  It was all\n",
       "pitiable, horrible; but this open avowal, insult as it was to the\n",
       "Comtesse Chantavoine, could be no worse than the rumours which would\n",
       "surely have reached her one day.  So let the game fare on.  He had thrown\n",
       "down the glove now, and he could not see the end; he was playing for one\n",
       "thing only--for the woman he had lost, for his own child.  If everything\n",
       "went by the board, why, it must go by the board.  It all flashed through\n",
       "his brain: to-morrow he must send in his resignation to the Admiralty--\n",
       "so much at once.  Then Bercy--come what might, there was work for him to\n",
       "do at Bercy.  He was a sovereign duke of Europe, as Guida had said.  He\n",
       "would fight for the duchy for his son's sake.  Standing there he could\n",
       "feel again the warm cheek of the child upon his own, as last night he\n",
       "felt it riding across the island from Plemont to the village near Mont\n",
       "Orgueil.  That very morning he had hurried down to a little cottage in\n",
       "the village and seen it lying asleep, well cared for by a peasant woman.\n",
       "He knew that to-morrow the scandal of the thing would belong to the\n",
       "world, but he was not dismayed.  He had tossed his fame as an admiral\n",
       "into the gutter, but Bercy still was left.  All the native force, the\n",
       "stubborn vigour, the obdurate spirit of the soil of Jersey of which he\n",
       "was, its arrogant self-will, drove him straight into this last issue.\n",
       "What he had got at so much cost he would keep against all the world.\n",
       "He would--\n",
       "\n",
       "But he stopped short in his thoughts, for there now at the court-room\n",
       "door stood Detricand, the Chouan chieftain.\n",
       "\n",
       "He drew his hand quickly across his eyes.  It seemed so wild, so\n",
       "fantastic, that of all men, Detricand should be there.  His gaze was so\n",
       "fixed that every one turned to see--every one save Guida.\n",
       "\n",
       "Guida was not conscious of this new figure in the scene.  In her heart\n",
       "was fierce tumult.  Her hour had come at last, the hour in which she must\n",
       "declare that she was the wife of this man.  She had no proofs.  No doubt\n",
       "he would deny it now, for he knew how she loathed him.  But she must tell\n",
       "her tale.\n",
       "\n",
       "She was about to address the Bailly, but, as though a pang of pity shot,\n",
       "through her heart, she turned instead and looked at the Comtesse\n",
       "Chantavoine.  She could find it in her to pause in compassion for this\n",
       "poor lady, more wronged than herself had been.  Their eyes met.  One\n",
       "instant's flash of intelligence between the souls of two women, and Guida\n",
       "knew that the look of the Comtesse Chantavoine had said: \"Speak for your\n",
       "child.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Thereupon she spoke.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Messieurs, Prince Philip d'Avranche is my husband.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Every one in the court-room stirred with excitement.  Some weak-nerved\n",
       "woman with a child at her breast began to cry, and the little one joined\n",
       "its feeble wail to hers.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Five years ago,\" Guida continued, \"I was married to Philip d'Avranche by\n",

       "\n",

       "the way-have done.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"May I not then be heard in my own defence?\" Guida cried in indignation.\n",
       "\"For years I have suffered silently slander and shame.  Now I speak for\n",
       "myself at last, and you will not hear me!  I come to this court of\n",
       "justice, and my word is doubted ere I can prove the truth.  Is it for\n",
       "judges to assail one so?  Five years ago I was married secretly, in St.\n",
       "Michael's Church--secretly, because Philip d'Avranche urged it, pleaded\n",
       "for it.  An open marriage, he said, would hinder his promotion.  We were\n",
       "wedded, and he left me.  War broke out.  I remained silent according to\n",
       "my promise to him.  Then came the time when in the States of Bercy he\n",
       "denied that he had a wife.  From the hour I knew he had done so I denied\n",
       "him.  My child was born in shame and sorrow, I myself was outcast in this\n",
       "island.  But my conscience was clear before Heaven.  I took myself and my\n",
       "child out from among you and went to Plemont.  I waited, believing that\n",
       "God's justice was surer than man's.  At last Philip d'Avranche--my\n",
       "husband--returned here.  He invaded my home, and begged me to come with\n",
       "my child to him as his wife--he who had so evilly wronged me, and wronged\n",
       "another more than me.  I refused.  Then he stole my child from me.  You\n",
       "ask for proofs of my marriage.  Messieurs, I have no proofs.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I know not where Lorenzo Dow may be found.  The register of St. Michael's\n",
       "Church, as you all know, was stolen.  Mr. Shoreham, who witnessed the\n",
       "marriage, is dead.  But you must believe me.  There is one witness left,\n",
       "if he will but speak--even the man who married me, the man that for one\n",
       "day called me his wife.  I ask him now to tell the truth.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She turned towards Philip, her clear eyes piercing him through and\n",
       "through.\n",
       "\n",
       "What was going on in his mind neither she nor any in that Court might\n",
       "ever know, for in the pause, the Comtesse Chantavoine rose up, and\n",
       "passing steadily by Philip, came to Guida.  Looking her in the eyes with\n",
       "an incredible sorrow, she took her hand, and turned towards Philip with\n",
       "infinite scorn.\n",
       "\n",
       "A strange, thrilling silence fell upon all the Court.  The jurats shifted\n",
       "in their seats with excitement.  The Bailly, in a hoarse, dry voice,\n",
       "said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We must have proof.  There must be record as well as witness.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "From near the great doorway came a voice saying: \"The record is here,\"\n",
       "and Detricand stepped forward, in his uniform of the army of the Vendee.\n",
       "\n",
       "A hushed murmur ran round the room.  The jurats whispered to each other.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who are you, monsieur?\" said the Bailly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am Detricand, Prince of Vaufontaine,\" he replied, \"for whom the\n",
       "Comtesse Chantavoine will vouch,\" he added in a pained voice, and bowed\n",
       "low to her and to Guida.  \"I am but this hour landed.  I came to Jersey\n",
       "on this very matter.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He did not wait for the Bailly to reply, but began to tell of the death\n",
       "of Lorenzo Dow, and, taking from his pocket the little black journal,\n",
       "opened it and read aloud the record written therein by the dead\n",
       "clergyman.  Having read it, he passed it on to the Greffier, who handed\n",
       "it up to the Bailly.  Another moment's pause ensued.  To the most\n",
       "ignorant and casual of the onlookers the strain was great; to those\n",
       "chiefly concerned it was supreme.  The Bailly and the jurats whispered\n",
       "together.  Now at last a spirit of justice was roused in them.  But the\n",
       "law's technicalities were still to rule.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Bailly closed the book, and handed it back to the Greffier with the\n",
       "words: \"This is not proof though it is evidence.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Guida felt her heart sink within her.  The Comtesse Chantavoine, who\n",
       "still held her hand, pressed it, though herself cold as ice with sickness\n",
       "of spirit.\n",
       "\n",
       "At that instant, and from Heaven knows where--as a bird comes from a\n",
       "bush--a little grey man came quickly among them all, carrying spread open\n",
       "before him a book almost as big as himself.  Handing it up to the Bailly,\n",
       "he said:\n",

       "\"Here is the proof, Monsieur le Bailly--here is the whole proof.\"\n",

       "island once more.  Intending to join Detricand in the Vendee, he had\n",
       "scarcely landed at St. Malo when he was seized by a press-gang and\n",
       "carried aboard a French frigate commissioned to ravage the coasts of\n",

       "In vain he protested that he was an Englishman.  They laughed at him.\n",

       "meanwhile remembering his four years' service with the artillery at\n",

       "Days and weeks passed, until one morning came the cry of \"Land!  Land!\"\n",

       "of the races of the air swarmed there; at times the air above was\n",
       "darkened by clouds of them.  No fog-bell on a rock-bound coast might warn\n",

       "No human being had ever mounted to this eyrie.  Generations of fishermen\n",
       "had looked upon the yellowish-red limestone of the Perce Rock with a\n",
       "valorous eye, but it would seem that not even the tiny clinging hoof of a\n",

       "Ranulph was roused out of the spell Perce cast over him by seeing the\n",

       "entering.  His heart gave a great bound.  Yes, it was the English flag\n",
       "defiantly flying.  And more--there were two old 12 pounders being trained\n",
       "on the French squadron.  For the first time in years a low laugh burst\n",
       "from his lips.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"O mai grand doux,\" he said in the Jersey patois, \"only one man in the\n",

       "\n",
       "\"That's a big splutter in a little pot, gunner,\" said he.  He put his\n",
       "telescope to his eye.  \"The Lord protect us,\" he cried, \"they're going to\n",
       "fight my ship!\"  He laughed again till the tears came.  \"Son of Peter,\n",
       "but it is droll that--a farce au diable!  They have humour, these fisher-\n",
       "folk, eh, gunner?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mattingley will fight you just the same,\" answered Ranulph coolly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh ho, you know these people, my gunner?\" asked Richambeau.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"All my life,\" answered Ranulph, \"and, by your leave, I will tell you\n",
       "how.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Not waiting for permission, after the manner of his country, he told\n",
       "Richambeau of his Jersey birth and bringing up, and how he was the victim\n",
       "of the pressgang.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very good,\" said Richambeau.  \"You Jersey folk were once Frenchmen, and\n",
       "now that you're French again, you shall do something for the flag.  You\n",
       "see that 12-pounder yonder to the right?  Very well, dismount it.  Then\n",
       "we'll send in a flag of truce, and parley with this Mattingley, for his\n",
       "jests are worth attention and politeness.  There's a fellow at the gun--\n",
       "no, he has gone.  Dismount the right-hand gun at one shot.  Ready now.\n",
       "Get a good range.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The whole matter went through Ranulph's mind as the captain spoke.  If he\n",
       "refused to fire, he would be strung up to the yardarm; if he fired and\n",
       "missed, perhaps other gunners would fire, and once started they might\n",
       "raze the fishing-post.  If he dismounted the gun, the matter would\n",
       "probably remain only a jest, for such as yet Richambeau regarded it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ranulph ordered the tackle and breechings cast away, had off the apron,\n",
       "pricked a cartridge, primed, bruised the priming, and covered the vent.\n",
       "Then he took his range steadily, quietly.  There was a brisk wind blowing\n",
       "from the south--he must allow for that; but the wind was stopped somewhat\n",
       "in its course by the Perch Rock--he must allow for that.\n",
       "\n",
       "All was ready.  Suddenly a girl came running round the corner of the\n",
       "building.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was Carterette.  She was making for the right-hand gun.  Ranulph\n",
       "started, the hand that held the match trembled.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Fire, you fool, or you'll kill the girl!\" cried Richambeau.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ranulph laid a hand on himself as it were.  Every nerve in his body\n",
       "tingled, his legs trembled, but his eye was steady.  He took the sight\n",
       "once more coolly, then blew on the match.  Now the girl was within thirty\n",
       "feet of the gun.\n",
       "\n",
       "He quickly blew on the match again, and fired.  When the smoke cleared\n",
       "away he saw that the gun was dismounted, and not ten feet from it stood\n",
       "Carterette looking at it dazedly.\n",
       "\n",
       "He heard a laugh behind him.  There was Richambeau walking away,\n",
       "telescope under arm, even as the other 12-pounder on shore replied\n",
       "impudently to the gun he had fired.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A good aim,\" he heard Richambeau say, jerking a finger backward towards\n",
       "him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Was it then?  said Ranulph to himself; was it indeed?  Ba su, it was the\n",
       "last shot he would ever fire against aught English, here or elsewhere.\n",
       "\n",
       "Presently he saw a boat drawing away with the flag of truce in the hands\n",
       "of a sous-lieutenant.  His mind was made up; he would escape to-night.\n",
       "His place was there beside his fellow-countrymen.  He motioned away the\n",
       "men of the gun.  He would load ma couzaine himself for the last time.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he sponged the gun he made his plans.  Swish-swash the sponge-staff\n",
       "ran in and out--he would try to steal away at dog-watch.  He struck the\n",
       "sponge smartly on ma couzaine's muzzle, cleansing it--he would have to\n",
       "slide into the water like a rat and swim very softly to the shore.  He\n",
       "reached for a fresh cartridge, and thrust it into the throat of the gun,\n",
       "and as the seam was laid downwards he said to himself that he could swim\n",
       "under water, if discovered as he left the Victoire.  As he unstopped the\n",
       "touch-hole and tried with the priming-wire whether the cartridge was\n",
       "home, he was stunned by a fresh thought.\n",
       "\n",
       "Richambeau would send a squad of men to search for him, and if he was not\n",
       "found they would probably raze the Post, or take its people prisoners.\n",
       "As he put the apron carefully on ma couzaine, he determined that he could\n",
       "not take refuge with the Mattingleys.  Neither would it do to make for\n",
       "the woods of the interior, for still Richambeau might revenge himself on\n",
       "the fishing-post.  What was to be done?  He turned his eyes helplessly on\n",
       "Perce Rock.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he looked, a new idea came to him.  If only he could get to the top of\n",
       "that massive wall, not a hundred fleets could dislodge him.  One musket\n",
       "could defeat the forlorn hope of any army.  Besides, if he took refuge on\n",
       "the rock, there could be no grudge against Perce village or the\n",
       "Mattingleys, and Richambeau would not injure them.\n",
       "\n",
       "He eyed the wall closely.  The blazing sunshine showed it up in a hard\n",
       "light, and he studied every square yard of it with a telescope.  At one\n",
       "point the wall was not quite perpendicular.  There were also narrow\n",
       "ledges, lumps of stone, natural steps and little pinnacles which the\n",
       "fingers could grip and where man might rest.  Yes, he would try it.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was the last quarter of the moon, and the neaptide was running low\n",
       "when he let himself softly down into the water from the Victoire.  The\n",
       "blanket tied on his head held food kept from his rations, with stone and\n",
       "flint and other things.  He was not seen, and he dropped away quietly\n",
       "astern, getting clear of the Victoire while the moon was partially\n",
       "obscured.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now it was a question when his desertion would be discovered.  All he\n",
       "asked was two clear hours.  By that time the deed would be done, if he\n",
       "could climb Perce Rock at all.\n",
       "\n",
       "He touched bottom.  He was on Perce sands.  The blanket on his head was\n",
       "scarcely wetted.  He wrung the water out of his clothes, and ran softly\n",
       "up the shore.  Suddenly he was met by a cry of Qui va la!  and he stopped\n",
       "short at the point of Elie Mattingley's bayonet.  \"Hush!\" said Ranulph,\n",
       "and gave his name.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mattingley nearly dropped his musket in surprise.  He soon knew the tale\n",
       "of Ranulph's misfortunes, but he had not yet been told of his present\n",
       "plans when there came a quick footstep, and Carterette was at her\n",
       "father's side.  Unlike Mattingley, she did drop her musket at the sight\n",
       "of Ranulph.  Her lips opened, but at first she could not speak--this was\n",
       "more than she had ever dared hope for, since those dark days\n",
       "in Jersey.  Ranulph here!  She pressed her hands to her heart to stop its\n",
       "throbbing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Presently she was trembling with excitement at the story of how Ranulph\n",
       "had been pressed at St. Malo, and, all that came after until this very\n",
       "day.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Go along with Carterette,\" said Mattingley.  \"Alixandre is at the house;\n",
       "he'll help you away into the woods.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "As Ranulph hurried away with Carterette, he told her his design.\n",
       "Suddenly she stopped short, \"Ranulph Delagarde,\" she said vehemently,\n",
       "\"you can't climb Perch Rock.  No one has ever done it, and you must not\n",
       "try.  Oh, I know you are a great man, but you mustn't think you can do\n",
       "this.  You will be safe where we shall hide you.  You shall not climb the\n",
       "rock-ah no, ba su!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He pointed towards the Post.  \"They wouldn't leave a stick standing there\n",
       "if you hid me.  No, I'm going to the top of the rock.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Man doux terrible!\" she said in sheer bewilderment, and then was\n",
       "suddenly inspired.  At last her time had come.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Pardingue,\" she said, clutching his arm, \"if you go to the top of Perch\n",
       "Rock, so will I!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "In spite of his anxiety he almost laughed.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But see--but see,\" he said, and his voice dropped; \"you couldn't stay up\n",
       "there with me all alone, garcon Carterette.  And Richambeau would be\n",
       "firing on you too!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She was very angry, but she made no reply, and he continued quickly:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I'll go straight to the rock now.  When they miss me there'll be a pot\n",
       "boiling, you may believe.  If I get up,\" he added, \"I'll let a string\n",
       "down for a rope you must get for me.  Once on top they can't hurt me....\n",
       "Eh ben, A bi'tot, gargon Carterette!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"O my good!  O my good!\" said the girl with a sudden change of mood.\n",
       "\"To think you have come like this, and perhaps--\" But she dashed the\n",
       "tears from her eyes, and bade him go on.\n",
       "\n",
       "The tide was well out, the moon shining brightly.  Ranulph reached the\n",
       "point where, if the rock was to be scaled at all, the ascent must be\n",
       "made.  For a distance there was shelving where foothold might be had by a\n",
       "fearless man with a steady head and sure balance.  After that came about\n",
       "a hundred feet where he would have to draw himself up by juttings and\n",
       "crevices hand over hand, where was no natural pathway.  Woe be to him if\n",
       "head grew dizzy, foot slipped, or strength gave out; he would be broken\n",
       "to pieces on the hard sand below.  That second stage once passed, the\n",
       "ascent thence to the top would be easier; for though nearly as steep, it\n",
       "had more ledges, and offered fair vantage to a man with a foot like a\n",
       "mountain goat.  Ranulph had been aloft all weathers in his time, and his\n",
       "toes were as strong as another man's foot, and surer.\n",
       "\n",
       "He started.  The toes caught in crevices, held on to ledges, glued\n",
       "themselves on to smooth surfaces; the knees clung like a rough-rider's to\n",
       "a saddle; the big hands, when once they got a purchase, fastened like an\n",
       "air-cup.\n",
       "\n",
       "Slowly, slowly up, foot by foot, yard by yard, until one-third of the\n",
       "distance was climbed.  The suspense and strain were immeasurable.  But he\n",
       "struggled on and on, and at last reached a sort of flying pinnacle of\n",
       "rock, like a hook for the shields of the gods.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here he ventured to look below, expecting to see Carterette, but there\n",
       "was only the white sand, and no sound save the long wash of the gulf.  He\n",
       "drew a horn of arrack from his pocket and drank.  He had two hundred feet\n",
       "more to climb, and the next hundred would be the great ordeal.\n",
       "\n",
       "He started again.  This was travail indeed.  His rough fingers, his toes,\n",
       "hard as horn almost, began bleeding.  Once or twice he swung quite clear\n",
       "of the wall, hanging by his fingers to catch a surer foothold to right or\n",
       "left, and just getting it sometimes by an inch or less.  The tension was\n",
       "terrible.  His head seemed to swell and fill with blood: on the top it\n",
       "throbbed till it was ready to burst.  His neck was aching horribly with\n",
       "constant looking up, the skin of his knees was gone, his ankles bruised.\n",
       "But he must keep on till he got to the top, or until he fell.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was fighting on now in a kind of dream, quite apart from all usual\n",
       "feelings of this world.  The earth itself seemed far away, and he was\n",
       "toiling among vastnesses, himself a giant with colossal frame and huge,\n",
       "sprawling limbs.  It was like a gruesome vision of the night, when the\n",
       "body is an elusive, stupendous mass that falls into space after a\n",
       "confused struggle with immensities.  It was all mechanical, vague, almost\n",
       "numb, this effort to overcome a mountain.  Yet it was precise and hugely\n",
       "expert too; for though there was a strange mist on the brain, the body\n",
       "felt its way with a singular certainty, as might some molluscan dweller\n",
       "of the sea, sensitive like a plant, intuitive like an animal.  Yet at\n",
       "times it seemed that this vast body overcoming the mountain must let go\n",
       "its hold and slide away into the darkness of the depths.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now there was a strange convulsive shiver in every nerve--God have mercy,\n",
       "the time was come!  .  .  .  No, not yet.  At the very instant when it\n",
       "seemed the panting flesh and blood would be shaken off by the granite\n",
       "force repelling it, the fingers, like long antennae, touched horns of\n",
       "rock jutting out from ledges on the third escarpment of the wall.  Here\n",
       "was the last point of the worst stage of the journey.  Slowly, heavily,\n",
       "the body drew up to the shelf of limestone, and crouched in an inert\n",
       "bundle.  There it lay for a long time.\n",
       "\n",
       "While the long minutes went by, a voice kept calling up from below;\n",
       "calling, calling, at first eagerly, then anxiously, then with terror.\n",
       "By and by the bundle of life stirred, took shape, raised itself, and was\n",
       "changed into a man again, a thinking, conscious being, who now understood\n",
       "the meaning of this sound coming up from the earth below--or was it the\n",
       "sea?  A human voice had at last pierced the awful exhaustion of the\n",
       "deadly labour, the peril and strife, which had numbed the brain while the\n",
       "body, in its instinct for existence, still clung to the rocky ledges.  It\n",
       "had called the man back to earth--he was no longer a great animal, and\n",
       "the rock a monster with skin and scales of stone.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ranulph!  Maitre Ranulph!  Ah, Ranulph!\" called the voice.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now he knew, and he answered down: \"All right, all right, garche\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Are you at the top?\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "There was silence for what seemed hours to the girl below.  Foot by foot\n",
       "the man climbed on, no less cautious because the ascent was easier, for\n",
       "he was now weaker.  But he was on the monster's neck now, and soon he\n",
       "should set his heel on it: he was not to be shaken off.\n",
       "\n",
       "At last the victorious moment came.  Over a jutting ledge he drew himself\n",
       "up by sheer strength and the rubber-like grip of his lacerated fingers,\n",
       "and now he lay flat and breathless upon the ground.\n",
       "\n",
       "How soft and cool it was!  This was long sweet grass touching his face,\n",
       "making a couch like down for the battered, wearied body.  Surely such\n",
       "travail had been more than mortal.  And what was this vast fluttering\n",
       "over his head, this million-voiced discord round him, like the buffetings\n",
       "and cries of spirits welcoming another to their torment?  He raised his\n",
       "head and laughed in triumph.  These were the cormorants, gulls, and\n",
       "gannets on the Perch Rock.\n",
       "\n",
       "Legions of birds circled over him with cries so shrill that at first he\n",
       "did not hear Carterette's voice calling up to him.  At last, however,\n",
       "remembering, he leaned over the cliff and saw her standing in the\n",
       "moonlight far below.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her voice came up to him indistinctly because of the clatter of the\n",
       "birds.  \"Maitre Ranulph!  Ranulph!\"  She could not see him, for this part\n",
       "of the rock was in shadow.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah bah, all right!\" he said, and taking hold of one end of the twine he\n",
       "had brought, he let the roll fall.  It dropped almost at Carterette's\n",
       "feet.  She tied to the end of it three loose ropes she had brought from\n",
       "the Post.  He drew them up quickly, tied them together firmly, and let\n",
       "the great coil down.  Ranulph's bundle, a tent and many things Carterette\n",
       "had brought were drawn up.\n",

       "\"That is no matter,\" she called softly.  \"He is coming.  He has the rope\n",

       "that he should be on Perch Rock alone, but the terrible strain had\n",
       "bewildered him, and he could make no protest now.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Don't start yet,\" he called down; \"I'll pull when all's ready.\"\n",

       "shrieked and honked till the air was a maelstrom of cries.  Then came\n",
       "another cannon-shot.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ranulph's desertion was discovered.  The fight was begun between a single\n",
       "Jersey shipwright and a French war-ship.\n",
       "\n",
       "His strength, however, could not last much longer.  Every muscle of his\n",
       "body had been strained and tortured, and even this lighter task tried him\n",
       "beyond endurance.  His legs stiffened against the ledge of rock, the\n",
       "tension numbed his arms.  He wondered how near Alixandre was to the top.\n",
       "Suddenly there was a pause, then a heavy jerk.  Love of God--the rope\n",
       "was shooting through his fingers, his legs were giving way!  He gathered\n",
       "himself together, and then with teeth, hands, and body rigid with\n",
       "enormous effort, he pulled and pulled.  Now he could not see.  A mist\n",
       "swam before his eyes.  Everything grew black, but he pulled on and on.\n",
       "\n",
       "He never knew how the climber reached the top.  But when the mist cleared\n",
       "away from his eyes, Carterette was bending over him, putting rum to his\n",
       "lips.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Carterette-garcon Carterette!\" he murmured, amazed.  Then as the truth\n",
       "burst upon him he shook his head in a troubled sort of way.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What a cat I was!\" said Carterette.  \"What a wild cat I was to make you\n",
       "haul me up!  It was bad for me with the rope round me, it must have been\n",
       "awful for you, my poor esmanus--poor scarecrow Ranulph.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Scarecrow indeed he looked.  His clothes were nearly gone, his hair was\n",
       "tossed and matted, his eyes bloodshot, his big hands like pieces of raw\n",
       "meat, his feet covered with blood.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My poor scarecrow!\" she repeated, and she tenderly wiped the blood from\n",
       "his face where his hands had touched it.  Meanwhile bugle-calls and cries\n",
       "of command came up to them, and in the first light of morning they could\n",
       "see French officers and sailors, Mattingley, Alixandre, and others,\n",
       "hurrying to and fro.\n",
       "\n",
       "When day came clear and bright, it was known that Carterette as well as\n",
       "Ranulph had vanished.  Mattingley shook his head stoically, but\n",
       "Richambeau on the Victoire was as keen to hunt down one Jersey-Englishman\n",
       "as he had ever been to attack an English fleet.  More so, perhaps.\n",
       "\n",
       "Meanwhile the birds kept up a wild turmoil and shrieking.  Never before\n",
       "had any one heard them so clamorous.  More than once Mattingley had\n",
       "looked at Perch Rock curiously, but whenever the thought of it as a\n",
       "refuge came to him, he put it away.  No, it was impossible.\n",
       "\n",
       "Yet, what was that?  Mattingley's heart thumped.  There were two people\n",
       "on the lofty island wall--a man and a woman.  He caught' the arm of a\n",
       "French officer near him.  \"Look, look!\" he said.  The officer raised his\n",
       "glass.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It's the gunner,\" he cried and handed the glass to the old man.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It's Carterette,\" said Mattingley in a hoarse voice.  \"But it's not\n",
       "possible.  It's not possible,\" he added helplessly.  \"Nobody was ever\n",
       "there.  My God, look at it--look at it!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was a picture indeed.  A man and a woman were outlined against the\n",
       "clear air, putting up a tent as calmly as though on a lawn, thousands of\n",
       "birds wheeling over their heads, with querulous cries.\n",
       "\n",
       "A few moments later, Elie Mattingley was being rowed swiftly to the\n",

       "his telescope.  He also had recognised the gunner.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was prepared to wipe out the fishing-post if Mattingley did not\n",
       "produce Ranulph--well, \"here was Ranulph duly produced and insultingly\n",
       "setting up a tent on this sheer rock, with some snippet of the devil,\"\n",
       "said Richambeau, and defying a great French war-ship.  He would set his\n",
       "gunners to work.  If he only had as good a marksman as Ranulph himself,\n",
       "the deserter should drop at the first shot \"death and the devil take his\n",
       "impudent face!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He was just about to give the order when Mattingley was brought to him.\n",
       "The old man's story amazed him beyond measure.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is no man, then!\" said Richambeau, when Mattingley had done.  \"He\n",
       "must be a damned fly to do it.  And the girl--sacre moi!  he drew her up\n",
       "after him.  I'll have him down out of that though, or throw up my flag,\"\n",
       "he added, and turning fiercely, gave his orders.\n",
       "\n",
       "For hours the Victoire bombarded the lonely rock from the north.  The\n",
       "white tent was carried away, but the cannon-balls flew over or merely\n",
       "battered the solid rock, the shells were thrown beyond, and no harm was\n",
       "done.  But now and again the figure of Ranulph appeared, and a half-dozen\n",
       "times he took aim with his musket at the French soldiers on the shore.\n",
       "Twice his shots took effect; one man was wounded, and one killed.  Then\n",
       "whole companies of marines returned a musketry fire at him, to no\n",
       "purpose.  At his ease he hid himself in the long grass at the edge of the\n",
       "cliff, and picked off two more men.\n",
       "\n",
       "Here was a ridiculous thing: one man and a slip of a girl fighting and\n",
       "defying a battle-ship.  The smoke of battle covered miles of the great\n",
       "gulf.  Even the seabirds shrieked in ridicule.\n",
       "\n",
       "This went on for three days at intervals.  With a fine chagrin Richambeau\n",
       "and his men saw a bright camp-fire lighted on the rock, and knew that\n",
       "Ranulph and the girl were cooking their meals in peace.  A flag-staff too\n",
       "was set up, and a red cloth waved defiantly in the breeze.  At last\n",
       "Richambeau, who had watched the whole business from the deck of the\n",
       "Victoire, burst out laughing, and sent for Elie Mattingley.  \"Come, I've\n",
       "had enough,\" said Richambeau.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There never was a wilder jest, and I'll not spoil the joke.  He has us\n",
       "on his toasting-fork.  He shall have the honour of a flag of truce.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "And so it was that the French battle-ship sent a flag of truce to the\n",
       "foot of Perch Rock, and a French officer, calling up, gave his captain's\n",
       "word of honour that Ranulph should suffer nothing at the hands of a\n",
       "court-martial, and that he should be treated as an English prisoner of\n",
       "war, not as a French deserter.\n",
       "\n",
       "There was no court-martial.  After Ranulph, at Richambeau's command, had\n",
       "told the tale of the ascent, the Frenchman said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No one but an Englishman could be fool enough to try such a thing, and\n",
       "none but a fool could have had the luck to succeed.  But even a fool can\n",
       "get a woman to follow him, and so this flyaway followed you, and--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Carterette made for Richambeau as though to scratch his eyes out, but\n",
       "Ranulph held her back.  \"--And you are condemned, gunner,\" continued\n",
       "Richambeau dryly, \"to marry the said maid before sundown, or be carried\n",
       "out to sea a prisoner of war.\"  So saying, he laughed, and bade them\n",
       "begone to the wedding.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ranulph left Richambeau's ship bewildered and perturbed.  For hours he\n",
       "paced the shore, and at last his thoughts began to clear.  The new life\n",
       "he had led during the last few months had brought many revelations.  He\n",
       "had come to realise that there are several sorts of happiness, but that\n",
       "all may be divided into two kinds: the happiness of doing good to\n",
       "ourselves, and that of doing good to others.  It opened out clearly to\n",
       "him now as he thought of Carterette in the light of Richambeau's coarse\n",
       "jest.\n",
       "\n",
       "For years he had known in a sort of way that Carterette preferred him to\n",
       "any other man.  He knew now that she had remained single because of him.\n",
       "For him her impatience had been patience, her fiery heart had spilled\n",
       "itself in tenderness for his misfortunes.  She who had lightly tossed\n",
       "lovers aside, her coquetry appeased, had to himself shown sincerity\n",
       "without coquetry, loyalty without selfishness.  He knew well that she had\n",
       "been his champion in dark days, that he had received far more from her\n",
       "than he had ever given--even of friendship.  In his own absorbing love\n",
       "for Guida Landresse, during long years he had been unconsciously blind to\n",
       "a devotion which had lived on without hope, without repining, with\n",
       "untiring cheerfulness.\n",
       "\n",
       "In those three days spent on the top of the Perch Rock how blithe garcon\n",
       "Carterette had been!  Danger had seemed nothing to her.  She had the\n",
       "temper of a man in her real enjoyment of the desperate chances of life.\n",
       "He had never seen her so buoyant; her animal spirits had never leapt so\n",
       "high.  And yet, despite the boldness which had sent her to the top of\n",
       "Perch Rock with him, there had been in her whole demeanour a frank\n",
       "modesty free from self-consciousness.  She could think for herself, she\n",
       "was sure of herself, and she would go to the ends of the earth for him.\n",
       "Surely he had not earned such friendship, such affection.\n",
       "\n",
       "He recalled how, the night before, as he sat by their little camp-fire,\n",
       "she had come and touched him on the shoulder, and, looking down at him,\n",
       "said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I feel as if I was beginning my life all over again, don't you, Maitre\n",
       "Ranulph?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Her black eyes had been fixed on his, and the fire in them was as bright\n",
       "and full of health and truth as the fire at his feet.\n",
       "\n",
       "And he had answered her: \"I think I feel that too, garcon Carterette.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "To which she had replied: \"It isn't hard to forget here--not so very\n",
       "hard, is it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She did not mean Guida, nor what he had felt for Guida, but rather the\n",
       "misery of the past.  He had nodded his head in reply, but had not spoken;\n",
       "and she, with a quick: \"A bi'tot,\" had taken her blanket and gone to that\n",
       "portion of the rock set apart for her own.  Then he had sat by the fire\n",
       "thinking through the long hours of night until the sun rose.  That day\n",
       "Richambeau had sent his flag of truce, and the end of their stay on Perch\n",
       "Rock was come.\n",
       "\n",
       "Yes, he would marry Carterette.  Yet he was not disloyal, even in memory.\n",
       "What had belonged to Guida belonged to her for ever, belonged to a past\n",
       "life with which henceforth he should have naught to do.  What had sprung\n",
       "up in his heart for Carterette belonged to the new life.  In this new\n",
       "land there was work to do--what might he not accomplish here?  He\n",
       "realised that within one life a man may still live several lives, each\n",
       "loyal and honest after its kind.  A fate stronger than himself had\n",
       "brought him here; and here he would stay with fate.  It had brought him\n",
       "to Carterette, and who could tell what good and contentment might not yet\n",
       "come to him, and how much to her!\n",
       "\n",
       "That evening he went to Carterette and asked her to be his wife.  She\n",
       "turned pale, and, looking up into his eyes with a kind of fear, she said\n",
       "brokenly:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It's not because you feel you must?  It's not because you know I love\n",
       "you, Ranulph--is it?  It's not for that alone?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is because I want you, garcon Carterette,\" he answered tenderly,\n",
       "\"because life will be nothing without you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am so happy--par made, I am so happy!\" she answered, and she hid her\n",

       "CHAPTER XLI\n",
       "\n",
       "Detricand, Prince of Vaufontaine, was no longer in the Vendee.  The whole\n",
       "of Brittany was in the hands of the victorious Hoche, the peasants were\n",
       "disbanded, and his work for a time at least was done.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the same day of that momentous scene in the Cohue Royale when Guida\n",
       "was vindicated, Detricand had carried to Granville the Comtesse\n",
       "Chantavoine, who presently was passed over to the loving care of her\n",
       "kinsman General Grandjon-Larisse.  This done, he proceeded to England.\n",
       "\n",
       "From London he communicated with Grandjon-Larisse, who applied himself\n",
       "to secure from the Directory leave for the Chouan chieftain to return to\n",
       "France, with amnesty for his past \"rebellion.\"  This was got at last\n",
       "through the influence of young Bonaparte himself.  Detricand was free now\n",
       "to proceed against Philip.\n",
       "\n",
       "He straightway devoted himself to a thing conceived on the day that Guida\n",
       "was restored to her rightful status as a wife.  His purpose now was to\n",
       "wrest from Philip the duchy of Bercy.  Philip was heir by adoption only,\n",
       "and the inheritance had been secured at the last by help of a lie--surely\n",
       "his was a righteous cause!\n",
       "\n",
       "His motives had not their origin in hatred of Philip alone, nor in desire\n",
       "for honours and estates for himself, nor in racial antagonism, for had he\n",
       "not been allied with England in this war against the Government?  He\n",
       "hated Philip the man, but he hated still more Philip the usurper who had\n",
       "brought shame to the escutcheon of Bercy.  There was also at work another\n",
       "and deeper design to be shown in good time.  Philip had retired from the\n",
       "English navy, and gone back to his duchy of Bercy.  Here he threw himself\n",
       "into the struggle with the Austrians against the French.  Received with\n",
       "enthusiasm by the people, who as yet knew little or nothing of the doings\n",
       "in the Cohue Royale, he now took over command of the army and proved\n",
       "himself almost as able in the field as he had been at sea.  Of these\n",
       "things Detricand knew, and knew also that the lines were closing in round\n",
       "the duchy; that one day soon Bonaparte would send a force which should\n",
       "strangle the little army and its Austrian allies.  The game then would be\n",
       "another step nearer the end.  Free to move at will, he visited the Courts\n",
       "of Prussia, Russia, Spain, Italy, and Austria, and laid before them his\n",
       "claims to the duchy, urging an insistence on its neutrality, and a trial\n",
       "of his cause against Philip.  Ceaselessly, adroitly, with persistence and\n",
       "power, he toiled towards his end, the way made easier by tales told of\n",
       "his prowess in the Vendee.  He had offers without number to take service\n",
       "in foreign armies, but he was not to be tempted.  Gossip of the Courts\n",
       "said that there was some strange romance behind this tireless pursuit of\n",
       "an inheritance, but he paid no heed.  If at last there crept over Europe\n",
       "wonderful tales of Detricand's past life in Jersey, of the real Duchesse\n",
       "de Bercy, and of the new Prince of Vaufontaine, Detricand did not, or\n",
       "feigned not to, hear them; and the Comtesse Chantavoine had disappeared\n",
       "from public knowledge.  The few who guessed his romance were puzzled to\n",
       "understand his cause: for if he dispossessed Philip, Guida must also be\n",
       "dispossessed.  This, certainly, was not lover-like or friendly.\n",
       "\n",
       "But Detricand was not at all puzzled; his mind and purpose were clear.\n",
       "Guida should come to no injury through him--Guida who, as they left the\n",
       "Cohue Royale that day of days, had turned on him a look of heavenly trust\n",
       "and gratitude; who, in the midst of her own great happenings, found time\n",
       "to tell him by a word how well she knew he had kept his promise to her,\n",
       "even beyond belief.  Justice for her was now the supreme and immediate\n",
       "object of his life.  There were others ready also to care for France, to\n",
       "fight for her, to die for her, to struggle towards the hour when the King\n",
       "should come to his own; but there was only one man in the world who could\n",
       "achieve Guida's full justification, and that was himself, Detricand of\n",

       "\n",

       "He was more active, and he was quicker and lighter of fence than his\n",
       "antagonist.  But Grandjon-Larisse had the surer eye, and was invincibly\n",

       "declare that honour was satisfied.  But neither would listen or heed;\n",
       "their purpose was fixed to fight to the death.  They engaged again, and\n",
       "almost at once the Frenchman was slightly wounded in the wrist.  Suddenly\n",
       "taking the offensive and lunging freely, Grandjon-Larisse drove Philip,\n",
       "now heated and less wary, backwards upon the wall.  At last, by a\n",
       "dexterous feint, he beat aside Philip's guard and drove the sword through\n",
       "his right breast at one fierce lunge.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "The child nodded his head gleefully, and his big eyes blinked with\n",
       "understanding.  \"Doesn't it ever stop?\" he asked.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This watch never stops,\" replied Detricand.  \"But there are plenty of\n",
       "watches that do.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I like watches,\" said the child sententiously.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Would you like this one?\" asked Detricand.\n",
       "\n",
       "The child drew in a gurgling breath of pleasure.  \"I like it.  Why\n",
       "doesn't mother have a watch?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The man did not answer the last question.  \"You like it?\" he said again,\n",
       "and he nodded his head towards the little fellow.  \"H'm, it keeps good\n",
       "time, excellent time it keeps,\" and he rose to meet the child's mother,\n",
       "who having just entered the room, stood looking at them.  It was Guida.\n",
       "She had heard the last words, and she glanced towards the watch\n",
       "curiously.  Detricand smiled in greeting, and said to her: \"Do you\n",
       "remember it?\"  He held up the watch.\n",
       "\n",
       "She came forward eagerly.  \"Is it--is it that indeed, the watch that the\n",
       "dear grandpethe--?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He nodded and smiled.  \"Yes, it has never once stopped since the moment\n",
       "he gave it me in the Vier-Marchi seven years ago.  It has had a charmed\n",
       "existence amid many rough doings and accidents.  I was always afraid of\n",
       "losing it, always afraid of an accident to it.  It has seemed to me that\n",
       "if I could keep it things would go right with me, and things come out\n",
       "right in the end.  Superstition, of course, but I lived a long time in\n",
       "Jersey.  I feel more a Jerseyman than a Frenchman sometimes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Although his look seemed to rest but casually on her face, it was evident\n",
       "he was anxious to feel the effect of every word upon her, and he added:\n",
       "\"When the Sieur de Mauprat gave me the watch he said, 'May no time be ill\n",
       "spent that it records for you.'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perhaps he knows his wish was fulfilled,\" answered Guida.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You think, then, that I've kept my promise?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am sure he would say so,\" she replied warmly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It isn't the promise I made to him that I mean, but the promise I made\n",
       "to you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She smiled brightly.  \"You know what I think of that.  I told you long\n",
       "ago.\"  She turned her head away, for a bright colour had come to her\n",
       "cheek.  \"You have done great things, Prince,\" she added in a low tone.\n",
       "\n",
       "He flashed a look of inquiry at her.  To his ear there was in her voice a\n",
       "little touch--not of bitterness, but of something, as it were, muffled or\n",
       "reserved.  Was she thinking how he had robbed her child of the chance of\n",
       "heritage at Bercy?  He did not reply, but, stooping, put the watch again\n",
       "to the child's ear.  \"There you are, monseigneur!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why do you call him monseigneur?\" she asked.  \"Guilbert has no title\n",
       "to your compliment.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "A look half-amused, half-perplexed, crossed over Detricand's face.  \"Do\n",
       "you think so?\" he said musingly.  Stooping once more, he said to the\n",
       "child: \"Would you like the watch?\" and added quickly, \"you shall have it\n",
       "when you're grown up.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do you really mean it?\" asked Guida, delighted; \"do you really mean to\n",
       "give him the grandpethe's watch one day?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh yes, at least that--one day.  But I have something more,\" he added\n",
       "quickly--\" something more for you;\" and he drew from his pocket a\n",
       "miniature set in rubies and diamonds.  \"I have brought you this from the\n",
       "Duc de Mauban--and this,\" he went on, taking a letter from his pocket,\n",
       "and handing it with the gift.  \"The Duke thought you might care to have\n",
       "it.  It is the face of your godmother, the Duchess Guidabaldine.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Guida looked at the miniature earnestly, and then said a little\n",
       "wistfully: \"How beautiful a face--but the jewels are much too fine for\n",
       "me!  What should one do here with rubies and diamonds?  How can I thank\n",
       "the Duke!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not so.  He will thank you for accepting it.  He begged me to say--as\n",
       "you will find by his letter to you--that if you will but go to him upon a\n",
       "visit with this great man here\"--pointing to the child with a smile--\n",
       "\"he will count it one of the greatest pleasures of his life.  He is too\n",
       "old to come to you, but he begs you to go to him--the Chevalier, and you,\n",
       "and Guilbert here.  He is much alone now, and he longs for a little of\n",
       "that friendship which can be given by but few in this world.  He counts\n",
       "upon your coming, for I said I thought you would.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It would seem so strange,\" she answered, \"to go from this cottage of my\n",
       "childhood, to which I have come back in peace at last--from this kitchen,\n",
       "to the chateau of the Duc de Mauban.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But it was sure to come,\" he answered.  \"This kitchen to which I come\n",
       "also to redeem my pledge after seven years, it belongs to one part of\n",
       "your life.  But there is another part to fulfil,\"--he stooped and passed\n",
       "his hands over the curls of the child,\" and for your child here you\n",
       "should do it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not find your meaning,\" she said after a moment's deliberation.\n",
       "\"I do not know what you would have me understand.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"In some ways you and I would be happier in simple surroundings,\" he\n",
       "replied gravely, \"but it would seem that to play duly our part in the\n",
       "world, we must needs move in wider circles.  To my mind this kitchen is\n",
       "the most delightful spot in the world.  Here I took a fresh commission of\n",
       "life.  I went out, a sort of battered remnant, to a forlorn hope; and now\n",
       "I come back to headquarters once again--not to be praised,\" he added in\n",
       "an ironical tone, and with a quick gesture of almost boyish shyness--\n",
       "\"not to be praised; only to show that from a grain of decency left in a\n",
       "man may grow up some sheaves of honest work and plain duty.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, it is much more than that, it is much, much more than that,\" she\n",
       "broke in.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, I am afraid it is not,\" he answered; \"but that is not what I wished\n",
       "to say.  I wished to say that for monseigneur here--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "A little flash of anger came into her eyes.  He is no monseigneur, he is\n",
       "Guilbert d'Avranche,\" she said bitterly.  \"It is not like you to mock my\n",
       "child, Prince.  Oh, I know you mean it playfully,\" she hurriedly added,\n",
       "\"but--but it does not sound right to me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"For the sake of monseigneur the heir to the duchy of Bercy,\" he added,\n",
       "laying his hand upon the child's head, \"these things your devout friends\n",
       "suggest, you should do, Princess.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Her clear unwavering eye looked steadfastly at him, but her face turned\n",
       "pale.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why do you call him monseigneur the heir to the duchy of Bercy?\" she\n",
       "said almost coldly, and with a little fear in her look too.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Because I have come here to tell you the truth, and to place in your\n",
       "hands the record of an act of justice.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Drawing from his pocket a parchment gorgeous with seals, he stooped, and\n",
       "taking the hands of the child, he placed it in them.  \"Hold it tight,\n",
       "hold it tight, my little friend, for it is your very own,\" he said to the\n",
       "child with cheerful kindliness.  Then stepping back a little, and looking\n",
       "earnestly at Guida, he added with a motion of the hand towards the child:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You must learn the truth from him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, what can you mean--what can you mean?\" she exclaimed.  Dropping\n",
       "upon her knees, and running an arm round the child, she opened the\n",
       "parchment and read.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What--what right has he to this?\" she cried in a voice of dismay.\n",
       "\"A year ago you dispossessed his father from the duchy.  Ah, I do not\n",
       "understand it!  You--only you are the Duc de Bercy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Her eyes were shining with a happy excitement and tenderness.  No such\n",
       "look had been in them for many a day.  Something that had long slept was\n",
       "waking in her, something long voiceless was speaking.  This man brought\n",
       "back to her heart a glow she had never thought to feel again, the glow of\n",
       "the wonder of life and of a girlish faith.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am only Detricand of Vaufontaine,\" he answered.  \"What, did you--could\n",
       "you think that I would dispossess your child?  His father was the adopted\n",
       "son of the Duc de Bercy.  Nothing could wipe that out, neither law nor\n",
       "nations.  You are always Princess Guida, and your child is always Prince\n",
       "Guilbert d'Avranche--and more than that.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "His voice became lower, his war-beaten face lighted with that fire and\n",
       "force which had made him during years past a figure in the war records of\n",
       "Europe.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I unseated Philip d'Avranche,\" he continued, \"because he acquired the\n",
       "duchy through--a misapprehension; because the claims of the House of\n",
       "Vaufontaine were greater.  We belonged; he was an alien.  He had a right\n",
       "to his adoption, he had no right to his duchy--no real right in the\n",
       "equity of nations.  But all the time I never forgot that the wife of\n",
       "Philip d'Avranche and her child had rights infinitely beyond his own.\n",
       "All that he achieved was theirs by every principle of justice.  My plain\n",
       "duty was to win for your child that succession belonging to him by all\n",
       "moral right.  When Philip d'Avranche was killed, I set to work to do for\n",
       "your child what had been done by another for Philip d'Avranche.  I have\n",
       "made him my heir.  When he is of age I shall abdicate from the duchy in\n",
       "his favour.  This deed, countersigned by the Powers that dispossessed his\n",
       "father, secures to him the duchy when he is old enough to govern.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Guida had listened like one in a dream.  A hundred feelings possessed\n",
       "her, and one more than all.  She suddenly saw all Detricand's goodness to\n",
       "her stretch out in a long line of devoted friendship, from this day to\n",
       "that far-off hour seven years before, when he had made a vow to her--\n",
       "kept how nobly!  Devoted friendship--was it devoted friendship alone,\n",
       "even with herself?  In a tumult of emotions she answered him hurriedly.\n",
       "\"No, no, no, no!  I cannot accept it.  This is not justice, this is a\n",
       "gift for which there is no example in the world's history.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I thought it best,\" he went on quietly, \"to govern Bercy myself during\n",
       "these troubled years.  So far its neutrality has been honoured, but who\n",
       "can tell what may come!  As a Vaufontaine it is my duty to see that\n",
       "Bercy's interests are duly protected amidst the troubles of Europe.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Guida got to her feet now and stood looking dazedly at the parchment in\n",
       "her hand.  The child, feeling himself neglected, ran out into the garden.\n",
       "\n",
       "There was moisture in Guida's eyes as she presently said: \"I had not\n",
       "thought that any man could be so noble--no, not even you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You should not doubt yourself so,\" he answered meaningly.  \"I am the\n",
       "work of your hands.  If I have fought my way back to reputable life\n",
       "again--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He paused, and took from his pocket a handkerchief.  \"This was the gage,\"\n",
       "he said, holding it up.  \"Do you remember the day I came to return it to\n",
       "you, and carried it off again?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It was foolish of you to keep it,\" she answered softly, \"as foolish of\n",
       "you as to think that I shall accept for my child these great honours.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But suppose the child in after years should blame you?\" he answered\n",
       "slowly and with emphasis.  \"Suppose that Guilbert should say, What right\n",
       "had you, my mother, to refuse what was my due?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This was the question she had asked herself long, long ago.  It smote her\n",
       "heart now.  What right had she to reject this gift of Fate to her child?\n",
       "\n",
       "Scarcely above a whisper she replied: \"Of course he might say that, but\n",
       "how, oh, how should we simple folk, he and I, be fitted for these high\n",
       "places--yet?  Now that what I desired all these years for him has come,\n",
       "I have not the courage.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have friends to help you in all you do,\" he answered meaningly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But friends cannot always be with one,\" she answered.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That depends upon the friends.  There is one friend of yours who has\n",
       "known you for eighteen years.  Eighteen years' growth should make a\n",
       "strong friendship--there was always friendship on his part at least.  He\n",
       "can be a still stronger and better friend.  He comes now to offer you the\n",
       "remainder of a life for which your own goodness is the guarantee.  He\n",
       "comes to offer you a love of which your own soul must be the only judge,\n",
       "for you have eyes that see and a spirit that knows.  The Chevalier needs\n",
       "you, and the Duc de Mauban needs you, but Detricand of Vaufontaine needs\n",
       "you a thousand times more.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, hush--but no, you must not!\" she broke in, her face all crimson,\n",
       "her lips trembling.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But yes, I must,\" he answered quickly.  \"You find peace here, but it is\n",
       "the peace of inaction.  It dulls the brain, and life winds in upon itself\n",
       "wearily at the last.  But out there is light and fire and action and the\n",
       "quick-beating pulse, and the joy of power wisely used, even to the end.\n",
       "You come of a great people, you were born to great things; your child has\n",
       "rights accorded now by every Court of Europe.  You must act for him.  For\n",
       "your child's sake, for my sake come out into the great field of life with\n",
       "me--as my wife, Guida.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She turned to him frankly, she looked at him steadfastly, the colour in\n",
       "her face came and went, but her eyes glowed with feeling.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"After all that has happened?\" she asked in a low tone.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It could only be because of all that has happened,\" he answered.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, no, you do not understand,\" she said quickly, a great pain in her\n",
       "voice.  \"I have suffered so, these many, many years!  I shall never be\n",
       "light-hearted again.  And I am not fitted for such high estate.  Do you\n",
       "not see what you ask of me--to go from this cottage to a palace?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I love you too well to ask you to do what you could not.  You must trust\n",
       "me,\" he answered, \"you must give your life its chance, you must--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But listen to me,\" she interjected with breaking tones; \"I know as\n",
       "surely as I know--as I know the face of my child, that the youth in me is\n",
       "dead.  My summer came--and went--long ago.  No, no, you do not\n",
       "understand--I would not make you unhappy.  I must live only to make my\n",
       "child happy.  That love has not been marred.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And I must be judge of what is for my own happiness.  And for yours--if\n",
       "I thought my love would make you unhappy for even one day, I should not\n",
       "offer it.  I am your lover, but I am also your friend.  Had it not been\n",
       "for you I might have slept in a drunkard's grave in Jersey.  Were it not\n",
       "for you, my bones would now be lying in the Vendee.  I left my peasants,\n",
       "I denied myself death with them to serve you.  The old cause is gone.\n",
       "You and your child are now my only cause--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You make it so hard for me,\" she broke in.  \"Think of the shadows from\n",
       "the past always in my eyes, always in my heart--you cannot wear the\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Shadows--friend of my soul, how should I dare come to you if there had\n",
       "never been shadows in your life!  It is because you--you have suffered,\n",
       "because you know, that I come.  Out of your miseries, the convict's\n",
       "lagging step, you say?  Think what I was.  There was never any wrong in\n",
       "you, but I was sunk in evil depths of folly--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I will not have you say so,\" she interrupted; \"you never in your life\n",
       "did a dishonourable thing.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then again I say, trust me.  For, on the honour of a Vaufontaine,\n",

       "he and I--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, you are so good to him!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You must give me chance and right to serve him.  What else have you or I\n",
       "to look forward to?  The honours of this world concern us little.  The\n",
       "brightest joys are not for us.  We have work before us, no rainbow\n",
       "ambitions.  But the boy--think for him---\" he paused.\n",
       "\n",
       "After a little, she held out her hand towards him.  \"Good-bye,\" she said\n",

       "\"Good-bye--you say good-bye to me!\" he exclaimed in dismay.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Till--till to-morrow,\" she answered, and she smiled.  The smile had a\n",
       "little touch of the old archness which was hers as a child, yet, too, a\n",
       "little of the sadness belonging to the woman.  But her hand-clasp was\n",
       "firm and strong; and her touch thrilled him.  Power was there, power with\n",
       "infinite gentleness.  And he understood her; which was more than all.\n",
       "\n",
       "He turned at the door.  She was standing very still, the parchment with\n",
       "the great seals yet in her hand.  Without speaking, she held it out to\n",
       "him, as though uncertain what to do with it.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he passed through the doorway he smiled, and said:\n",

       "Hobart--you, who really love me--to engage in an affair of this nature,\n",
       "at the expense of my honour, and the hazard of a thousand inconveniences!\n",
       "If such frailties are sometimes excusable, they certainly are not so in\n",
       "the high station in which I am placed; and it would be an ill-requital on\n",
       "my part for his goodness who raised me to the rank I now fill to----\"\n",
       "\"All this is very fine,\" interrupted Miss Hobart: \"but is it not very\n",
       "well known that he only married you because he was importuned so to do?\n",
       "Since that I refer to yourself whether he has ever restrained his\n",
       "inclination a single moment, giving you the most convincing proofs of\n",
       "the change that has taken place in his heart, by a thousand provoking\n",
       "infidelities? Is it still your intention to persevere in a state of\n",
       "indolence and humility, whilst the duke, after having received the\n",
       "favours, or suffered the repulses, of all the coquettes in England, pays\n",
       "his addresses to the maids of honour, one after the other, and at present\n",
       "places his whole ambition and desires in the conquest of that ugly\n",
       "skeleton, Churchill? What! Madam, must then your prime of life be spent\n",
       "in a sort of widowhood in deploring your misfortunes, without ever being\n",
       "permitted to make use of any remedy that may offer? A woman must be\n",
       "endowed with insuperable patience, or with an inexhaustible degree of\n",
       "resignation, to bear this. Can a husband, who disregards you both night\n",
       "and day, really suppose, because his wife eats and drinks heartily, as,\n",
       "God be thanked, your royal highness does, that she wants nothing else\n",
       "than to sleep well too? Faith, such conduct is too bad: I therefore once\n",
       "more repeat that there is not a princess in the universe who would refuse\n",
       "the homage of a man like Sidney, when a husband pays his addresses\n",
       "elsewhere.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "These reasons were certainly not morally good; but had they been still\n",
       "worse the duchess would have yielded to them, so much did her heart act\n",
       "in concert with Miss Hobart, to overthrow her discretion and prudence.\n",
       "\n",
       "This intrigue began at the very time that Miss Hobart advised Miss Temple\n",
       "not to give any encouragement to the addresses of the handsome Sidney.\n",
       "As for him, no sooner was he informed by the confidant Hobart that\n",
       "the goddess accepted his adoration than he immediately began to be\n",
       "particularly reserved and circumspect in his behaviour, in order to\n",
       "divert the attention of the public; but the public is not so easily\n",
       "deceived as some people imagine.\n",
       "\n",
       "As there were too many spies, too many inquisitive people and critics, in\n",
       "a numerous court, residing in the midst of a populous city, the duchess\n",
       "to avoid exposing the inclinations of her heart to the scrutiny of so\n",
       "many inquisitors, engaged the Duke of York to undertake the journey\n",
       "before mentioned, whilst the queen and her court were at Tunbridge.\n",
       "\n",
       "This conduct was prudent; and, if agreeable to her, was far from\n",
       "displeasing to any of her court, except Miss Jennings: Jermyn was not of\n",
       "the party; and, in her opinion, every party was insipid in which he was\n",
       "not one of the company. He had engaged himself in an enterprise above\n",
       "his strength, in laying a wager which the Chevalier de Grammont had laid\n",
       "before, and lost. He betted five hundred guineas that he would ride\n",
       "twenty miles in one hour upon the same horse, in the high road. The day\n",
       "he had fixed upon for this race was the very same in which Miss Jennings\n",
       "went to the fortune-teller's.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jermyn was more fortunate than her in this undertaking he came off\n",
       "victorious; but as his courage had far exceeded the strength of his\n",
       "constitution in this exertion to win the wager, he got a violent fever\n",
       "into the bargain, which brought him very low. Miss Jennings inquired\n",
       "after his health; but that was all she dared to do. In modern romances,\n",
       "a princess need only pay a visit to some hero, abandoned by his\n",
       "physicians, a perfect cure would be wrought in three days; but since Miss\n",
       "Jennings had not been the cause of Jermyn's fever, she was not certain of\n",
       "relieving him from it, although she had been sure that a charitable visit\n",
       "would not have been censured in a malicious court. Without therefore\n",
       "paying any attention to the uneasiness she might feel upon the occasion,\n",
       "the court set out without him: she had, however, the gratification to\n",
       "testify her ill-humour throughout the whole journey, by appearing\n",
       "displeased with everything which seemed to afford satisfaction to\n",
       "all the rest of the company.\n",
       "\n",
       "Talbot made one of the company; and flattering himself that the absence\n",
       "of a dangerous rival might produce some change in his favour, he was\n",
       "attentive to all the actions, motions, and even gestures, of his former\n",
       "mistress. There was certainly enough fully to employ his attention: it\n",
       "was contrary to her disposition to remain long in a serious humour. Her\n",
       "natural vivacity hurried her away, from being seemingly lost in thought,\n",
       "into sallies of wit, which afforded him hopes that she would soon forget\n",
       "Jermyn, and remember that his own passion was the first she had\n",
       "encouraged. However, he kept his distance, notwithstanding his love and\n",
       "his hopes, being of opinion that it ill became an injured lover to betray\n",
       "either the least weakness, or the smallest return of affection, for an\n",
       "ungrateful mistress, who had deserted him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Miss Jennings was so far from thinking of his resentments, that she\n",
       "did not even recollect he had ever paid his addresses to her; and her\n",
       "thoughts being wholly occupied upon the poor sick man, she conducted\n",
       "herself towards Talbot as if they never had had anything to say to each\n",
       "other. It was to him that she most usually gave her hand, either in\n",
       "getting into or out of the coach; she conversed more readily with him\n",
       "than any other person, and, without intending it, did everything to make\n",
       "the court believe she was cured of her passion for Jermyn in favour of\n",
       "her former lover.\n",
       "\n",
       "Of this he seemed likewise convinced, as well as the rest; and thinking\n",
       "it now proper to act another part, in order to let her know that his\n",
       "sentiments with respect to her were still the same, he had resolved to\n",
       "address her in the most tender and affectionate manner upon this subject.\n",
       "Fortune seemed to have favoured him, and to have smoothed the way for\n",
       "this intended harangue: he was alone with her in her chamber; and, what\n",
       "was still better, she was rallying him concerning Miss Boynton; saying,\n",
       "\"that they were undoubtedly much obliged to him for attending them on\n",
       "their journey, whilst poor Miss Boynton had fainting fits at Tunbridge,\n",
       "at least twice every day, for love of him.\" Upon this discourse, Talbot\n",
       "thought it right to begin the recital of his sufferings and fidelity,\n",
       "when Miss Temple, with a paper in her hand, entered the room. This was a\n",
       "letter in verse, which Lord Rochester had written some time before, upon\n",
       "the intrigues of the two courts; wherein, upon the subject of Miss\n",
       "Jennings, he said: \"that Talbot had struck terror among the people of\n",
       "God, by his gigantic stature; but that Jermyn, like a little David, had\n",
       "vanquished the great Goliath.\" Jennings, delighted with this allusion,\n",
       "read it over two or three times, thought it more entertaining than\n",
       "Talbot's conversation, at first heartily laughed at it, but soon after,\n",
       "with a tender air, \"Poor little David!\" said she, with a deep sigh, and\n",
       "turning her head on one side during this short reverie, she shed a few\n",
       "tears, which assuredly did not flow for the defeat of the giant. This\n",
       "stung Talbot to the quick; and, seeing himself so ridiculously deceived\n",
       "in his hopes, he went abruptly out of the room, vowing never to think any\n",
       "more of a giddy girl, whose conduct was regulated neither by sense nor\n",
       "reason; but he did not keep his resolution.\n",
       "\n",
       "The other votaries of love, who were numerous in this court, were more\n",
       "successful, the journey being undertaken solely on that account. There\n",
       "were continual balls and entertainments upon the road; hunting, and all\n",
       "other diversions, wherever the court halted in its progress. The tender\n",
       "lovers flattered themselves with the thought of being able to crown their\n",
       "happiness as they proceeded in their journey; and the beauties who\n",
       "governed their destiny did not forbid them to hope. Sidney paid his\n",
       "court with wonderful assiduity: the duchess made the duke take notice of\n",
       "his late perfect devotion to his service: his royal highness observed it,\n",
       "and agreed that he ought to be remembered upon the first opportunity,\n",
       "which happened soon after.\n",
       "\n",
       "Montagu, as before mentioned, was master of the horse to the duchess:\n",
       "he was possessed of a great deal of wit, had much penetration, and loved\n",
       "mischief. How could she bear such a man near her person, in the present\n",
       "situation of her heart? This greatly embarrassed her; but Montagu's\n",
       "elder brother having, very a-propos, got himself killed where he had no\n",
       "business, the duke obtained for Montagu the post of master of the horse\n",
       "to the queen, which the deceased enjoyed; and the handsome Sidney was\n",
       "appointed to succeed him in the same employment to the duchess. All this\n",
       "happened according to her wish; and the duke was highly pleased that he\n",
       "had found means to promote these two gentlemen at once, without being at\n",
       "the least expense.\n",
       "\n",
       "Miss Hobart greatly applauded these promotions: she had frequent and long\n",
       "conversations with Sidney, which, being remarked, some did her the honour\n",
       "to believe it was upon her own account; and the compliments that were\n",
       "made her upon the occasion she most willingly received. The duke, who\n",
       "believed it at first, observed to the duchess the unaccountable taste of\n",
       "certain persons, and how the handsomest young fellow in England was\n",
       "infatuated with such a frightful creature.\n",
       "\n",
       "The duchess confessed that taste was very arbitrary; the truth whereof he\n",
       "himself seemed to be convinced of, since he had fixed upon the beauteous\n",
       "Helen for his mistress. I know not whether this raillery caused him to\n",
       "reflect for what reasons he had made his choice; but it is certain he\n",
       "began to cool in his affections for Miss Churchill; and perhaps he would\n",
       "entirely have abandoned this pursuit, had not an accident taken place,\n",
       "which raised in him an entirely new inclination for her.\n",
       "\n",
       "The court having halted for a few days in a fine open country, the\n",
       "duchess was desirous of seeing a greyhound course. This diversion is\n",
       "practised in England upon large downs, where the turf, eaten by the\n",
       "sheep, is particularly green, and wonderfully even. She was in her\n",
       "coach, and all the ladies on horseback, every one of them being attended\n",
       "by her squire; it therefore was but reasonable that the mistress should\n",
       "likewise have her squire. He accordingly was at the side of her coach,\n",
       "and seemed to compensate for his deficiencies in conversation, by the\n",
       "uncommon beauty of his mien and figure.\n",
       "\n",
       "The duke attended Miss Churchill, not for the sake of besieging her with\n",
       "soft flattering tales of love, but, on the contrary, to chide her for\n",
       "sitting so ill on horseback: She was one of the most indolent creatures\n",
       "in the world; and although the maids of honour are generally the worst\n",
       "mounted of the whole court, yet, in order to distinguish her, on account\n",
       "of the favour she enjoyed, they had given her a very pretty, though\n",
       "rather a high-spirited horse; a distinction she would very willingly\n",
       "have excused them.\n",
       "\n",
       "The embarrassment and fear she was under had added to her natural\n",
       "paleness. In this situation, her countenance had almost completed the\n",
       "duke's disgust, when her horse, desirous of keeping pace with the others,\n",
       "set off in a gallop, notwithstanding her greatest efforts to prevent it;\n",
       "and her endeavours to hold him in, firing his mettle, he at length set\n",
       "off at full speed, as if he was running a race against the duke's horse.\n",
       "\n",
       "Miss Churchill lost her seat, screamed out, and fell from her horse.\n",
       "A fall in so quick a pace must have been violent; and yet it proved\n",
       "favourable to her in every respect; for, without receiving any hurt, she\n",
       "gave the lie to all the unfavourable suppositions that had been formed of\n",
       "her person, in judging from her face. The duke alighted, in order to\n",
       "help her: she was so greatly stunned, that her thoughts were otherwise\n",
       "employed than about decency on the present occasion; and those who first\n",
       "crowded around her found her rather in a negligent posture: they could\n",
       "hardly believe that limbs of such exquisite beauty could belong to Miss\n",
       "Churchill's face. After this accident, it was remarked that the duke's\n",
       "tenderness and affection for her increased every day; and, towards the\n",
       "end of the winter, it appeared that she had not tyrannized over his\n",
       "passion, nor made him languish with impatience.\n",
       "\n",
       "The two courts returned to London much about the same time, equally\n",
       "satisfied with their respective excursions; though the queen was\n",
       "disappointed in the hopes she had entertained of the good effects\n",
       "of the Tunbridge waters.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was about this time that the Chevalier de Grammont received a letter\n",
       "from the Marchioness de Saint-Chaumont, his sister, acquainting him, that\n",
       "he might return when he thought proper, the king having given him leave.\n",
       "He would have received this news with joy at any other time, whatever had\n",
       "been the charms of the English court; but, in the present situation of\n",
       "his heart, he could not resolve to quit it.\n",
       "\n",
       "He had returned from Tunbridge a thousand times deeper in love than\n",
       "ever; for, during this agreeable excursion, he had every day seen Miss\n",
       "Hamilton, either in the marshes of melancholy Peckham, or in the\n",
       "delicious walks of cheerful Summerhill, or in the daily diversions and\n",
       "entertainments of the queen's court; and whether he saw her on horseback,\n",
       "heard her conversation, or observed her in the dance, still he was\n",
       "persuaded that Heaven had never formed an object in every respect more\n",
       "worthy of the love, and more deserving of the affection, of a man of\n",
       "sense and delicacy. How then was it possible for him to bear the\n",
       "thoughts of leaving her? This appeared to him absolutely impracticable;\n",
       "however, as he was desirous of making a merit with her, of the\n",
       "determination he had made to neglect his fortune, rather than to be\n",
       "separated from her charms, he showed her his sister's letter: but this\n",
       "confidence had not the success he expected.\n",

       "gallantry, however sensibly she might feel this mark of his tenderness,\n",
       "she was, however, determined not to abuse it. In vain did he protest\n",
       "that he would rather meet death than part from her irresistible charms;\n",
       "and her irresistible charms protested that he should never see them more,\n",
