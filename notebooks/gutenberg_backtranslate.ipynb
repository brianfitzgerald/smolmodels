The paragraph should revolve around a character named Weyburn who is reflecting on his interactions with a woman named Aminta and her relationship with another man, Morsfield. Weyburn's thoughts should delve into the significance of Morsfield's behavior and Aminta's reactions, highlighting her admiration for masculine beauty and her desire to belong to a world of elegance and sophistication. The narrative should also touch on Weyburn's own aspirations and his perception of Aminta's magical allure, contrasting it with his more practical and abstract thoughts about his future.

The character should express a mix of guilt, longing, and hope, with a focus on the struggle between past regrets and the desire for spiritual salvation.
