       "Friday.--Julia is here, and so kind!  She has not mentioned his name, but\n",
       "she sighed so deeply when she saw my pale and sunken countenance, that I\n",
       "threw myself into her arms and cried like a child.  We had no need of\n",
       "other explanation: those tears spoke at once my confession and my\n",
       "repentance.  No letter from him for several days!  Surely he is not ill!\n",
       "how miserable that thought makes me!\n",
       "\n",
       "Saturday.--A note has just been brought me from him.  He is come\n",
       "back-here!  Good heavens!  how very imprudent!  I am so agitated that I\n",
       "can write no more.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sunday.--I have seen him!  Let me repeat that sentence--I have seen him.\n",
       "Oh that moment! did it not atone for all that I have suffered?  I dare\n",
       "not write everything he said, but he wished me to fly with him--him--what\n",
       "happiness, yet what guilt, in the very thought!  Oh! this foolish heart\n",
       "--would that it might break!  I feel too well the sophistry of his\n",
       "arguments, and yet I cannot resist them.  He seems to have thrown a spell\n",
       "over me, which precludes even the effort to escape.\n",
       "\n",
       "Monday.--Mr. Mandeville has asked several people in the country to dine\n",
       "here to-morrow, and there is to be a ball in the evening.  Falkland is of\n",
       "course invited.  We shall meet then, and how?  I have been so little\n",
       "accustomed to disguise my feelings, that I quite tremble to meet him with\n",
       "so many witnesses around.  Mr. Mandeville has been so harsh to me to-day;\n",
       "if Falkland ever looked at me so, or ever said one such word, my heart\n",
       "would indeed break.  What is it Alfieri says about the two demons to whom\n",
       "he is for ever a prey?  \"_La mente e il cor in perpetua lite_.\"  Alas!\n",
       "at times I start from my reveries with such a keen sense of agony and\n",

       "Wednesday morning.--The night is over, thank Heaven!  Falkland came late\n",
       "to dinner: every one else was assembled.  How gracefully he entered! how\n",
       "superior he seemed to all the crowd that stood around him!  He appeared\n",
       "as if he were resolved to exert powers which he had disdained before.  He\n",
       "entered into the conversation, not only with such brilliancy, but with\n",
       "such a blandness and courtesy of manner!  There was no scorn on his lip,\n",
       "no haughtiness on his forehead--nothing which showed him for a moment\n",
       "conscious of his immeasurable superiority over every one present.  After\n",
       "dinner, as we retired, I caught his eyes.  What volumes they told! and\n",
       "then I had to listen to his praises, and say nothing.  I felt angry even\n",
       "in my pleasure.  Who but I had a right to speak of him so well!\n",
       "\n",
       "The ball came on: I felt languid and dispirited.  Falkland did not dance.\n",
       "He sat: himself by me--he urged me to--O God!  O God! would that I were\n",

       "How are you this morning, my adored friend?  You seemed pale and ill when\n",
       "we parted last night, and I shall be so unhappy till I hear something of\n",
       "you.  Oh, Emily, when you listened to me with those tearful and downcast\n",
       "looks; when I saw your bosom heave at every word which I whispered in\n",
       "your ear; when, as I accidentally touched your hand, I felt it tremble\n",
       "beneath my own; oh! was there nothing in those moments at your heart\n",
       "which pleaded for me more eloquently than words?  Pure and holy as you\n",
       "are, you know not, it is true, the feelings which burn and madden in me.\n",
       "When you are beside me, your hand, if it trembles, is not on fire, your\n",
       "voice, if it is more subdued, does not falter with the emotions it dares\n",
       "not express: your heart is not like mine, devoured by a parching and\n",
       "wasting flame: your sleep is not turned by restless and turbulent dreams\n",
       "from the healthful renewal, into the very consumer, of life.  No, Emily!\n",
       "God forbid that you should feel the guilt, the agony which preys upon me;\n",
       "but, at least, in the fond and gentle tenderness of your heart, there\n",
       "must be a voice you find it difficult to silence.  Amidst all the\n",
       "fictitious ties and fascinations of art, you cannot dismiss from your\n",
       "bosom the unconquerable impulse of nature.  What is it you fear?--you\n",
       "will answer, disgrace!  But can you feel it, Emily, when you share it\n",
       "with me?  Believe me that the love which is nursed through shame and\n",
       "sorrow is of a deeper and holier nature than that which is reared in\n",
       "pride, fostered in joy.  But, if not shame, it is guilt, perhaps, which\n",
       "you dread?  Are you then so innocent now?  The adultery of the heart is\n",
       "no less a crime than that of the deed; and--yet I will not deceive you--\n",
       "it is guilt to which I tempt you!--it is a fall from the proud eminence\n",
       "you hold now.  I grant this, and I offer you nothing in recompense but my\n",
       "love.  If you loved like me, you would feel that it was something of\n",
       "pride--of triumph--to dare all things, even crime, for the one to whom\n",
       "all things are as nought!  As for me, I know that if a voice from Heaven\n",
       "told me to desert you, I would only clasp you the closer to my heart!\n",
       "\n",
       "I tell you, my own love, that when your hand is in mine, when your head\n",
       "rests upon my bosom, when those soft and thrilling eyes shall be fixed\n",
       "upon my own, when every sigh shall be mingled with my breath, and every\n",
       "tear be kissed away at the very instant it rises from its source--I tell\n",
       "you that then you shall only feel that every pang of the past, and every\n",
       "fear for the future, shall be but a new link to bind us the firmer to\n",
       "each other.  Emily, my life, my love, you cannot, if you would, desert\n",
       "me.  Who can separate the waters which are once united, or divide the\n",
       "hearts which have met and mingled into one?\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Since they had once more met, it will be perceived that Falkland had\n",
       "adopted a new tone in expressing his passion to Emily.  In the book of\n",
       "guilt another page, branded in a deeper and more burning character, had\n",
       "been turned.  He lost no opportunity of summoning the earthlier emotions\n",
       "to the support of his cause.  He wooed her fancy with the golden language\n",
       "of poetry, and strove to arouse the latent feelings of her sex by the\n",
       "soft magic of his voice, and the passionate meaning it conveyed.  But at\n",
       "times there came over him a deep and keen sentiment of remorse; and even,\n",
       "as his experienced and practised eye saw the moment of his triumph\n",
       "approach, he felt that the success he was hazarding his own soul and hers\n",
       "to obtain, might bring him a momentary transport, but not a permanent\n",
       "happiness.  There is always this difference in the love of women and of\n",
       "men; that in the former, when once admitted, it engrosses all the sources\n",
       "of thought, and excludes every object but itself; but in the latter, it\n",
       "is shared with all the former reflections and feelings which the past yet\n",
       "bequeaths us, and can neither (however powerful be its nature) constitute\n",
       "the whole of our happiness or woe.  The love of man in his maturer years\n",
       "is not indeed so much a new emotion, as a revival and concentration of\n",
       "all his departed affections to others; and the deep and intense nature of\n",
       "Falkland's passion for Emily was linked with the recollections of\n",
       "whatever he had formerly cherished as tender or dear; it touched--\n",
       "it awoke a long chain of young and enthusiastic feelings, which arose,\n",
       "perhaps, the fresher from their slumber.  Who, when he turns to recall\n",
       "his first and fondest associations; when he throws off, one by one, the\n",
       "layers of earth and stone which have grown and hardened over the records\n",
       "of the past: who has not been surprised to discover how fresh and\n",
       "unimpaired those buried treasures rise again upon his heart?  They have\n",
       "been laid up in the storehouse of Time; they have not perished; their\n",
       "very concealment has preserved them! _We remove the lava, and the world\n",
       "of a gone day is before us_!\n",
       "\n",
       "The evening of the day on which Falkland had written the above letter was\n",
       "rude and stormy.  The various streams with which the country abounded\n",
       "were swelled by late rains into an unwonted rapidity and breadth; and\n",
       "their voices blended with the rushing sound of the winds, and the distant\n",
       "roll of the thunder, which began at last sullenly to subside.  The whole\n",
       "of the scene around L------ was of that savage yet sublime character,\n",
       "which suited well with the wrath of the aroused elements.  Dark woods,\n",
       "large tracts of unenclosed heath, abrupt variations of hill and vale, and\n",
       "a dim and broken outline beyond of uninterrupted mountains, formed the\n",
       "great features of that romantic country.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was filled with the recollections of his youth, and of the wild\n",
       "delight which he took then in the convulsions and varieties of nature,\n",
       "that Falkland roamed abroad that evening.  The dim shadows of years,\n",
       "crowded with concealed events and corroding reflections, all gathered\n",
       "around his mind, and the gloom and tempest of the night came over him\n",
       "like the sympathy of a friend.\n",
       "\n",
       "He passed a group of terrified peasants; they were cowering under a tree.\n",
       "The oldest hid his head and shuddered; but the youngest looked steadily\n",
       "at the lightning which played at fitful intervals over the mountain\n",
       "stream that rushed rapidly by their feet.  Falkland stood beside them\n",
       "unnoticed and silent, with folded arms and a scornful lip.  To him,\n",
       "nature, heaven, earth had nothing for fear, and everything for\n",
       "reflection.  In youth, thought he (as he contrasted the fear felt at one\n",
       "period of life with the indifference at another), there are so many\n",
       "objects to divide and distract life, that we are scarcely sensible of the\n",
       "collected conviction that we live.  We lose the sense of what is by\n",
       "thinking rather of what is to be.  But the old, who have no future to\n",
       "expect, are more vividly alive to the present, and they feel death more,\n",
       "because they have a more settled and perfect impression of existence.\n",
       "\n",
       "He left the group, and went on alone by the margin of the winding and\n",
       "swelling stream.  \"It is (said a certain philosopher) in the conflicts of\n",
       "Nature that man most feels his littleness.\"  Like all general maxims,\n",
       "this is only partially true.  The mind, which takes its first ideas from\n",
       "perception, must take also its tone from the character of the objects\n",
       "perceived.  In mingling our spirits with the great elements, we partake\n",
       "of their sublimity; we awaken thought from the secret depths where it had\n",
       "lain concealed; our feelings are too excited to remain riveted to\n",
       "ourselves; they blend with the mighty powers which are abroad; and as, in\n",
       "the agitations of men, the individual arouses from himself to become a\n",
       "part of the crowd, so in the convulsions of nature we are equally\n",
       "awakened from the littleness of self, to be lost in the grandeur of the\n",
       "conflict by which we are surrounded.\n",
       "\n",
       "Falkland still continued to track the stream: it wound its way through\n",
       "Mandeville's grounds, and broadened at last into the lake which was so\n",
       "consecrated to his recollections.  He paused at that spot for some\n",
       "moments, looking carelessly over the wide expanse of waters, now dark as\n",
       "night, and now flashing into one mighty plain of fire beneath the\n",
       "coruscations of the lightning.  The clouds swept on in massy columns,\n",
       "dark and aspiring-veiling, while they rolled up to, the great heavens,\n",
       "like the shadows of human doubt.  Oh! weak, weak was that dogma of the\n",
       "philosopher!  There is a pride in the storm which, according to his\n",
       "doctrine, would debase us; a stirring music in its roar; even a savage\n",
       "joy in its destruction: for we can exult in a defiance of its power, even\n",
       "while we share in its triumphs, in a consciousness of a superior spirit\n",
       "within us to that which is around.  We can mock at the fury of the\n",
       "elements, for they are less terrible than the passions of the heart; at\n",
       "the devastations of the awful skies, for they are less desolating than\n",
       "the wrath of man; at the convulsions of that surrounding nature which has\n",
       "no peril, no terror to the soul, which is more indestructible and eternal\n",
       "than itself.  Falkland turned towards the house which contained his\n",
       "world; and as the lightning revealed at intervals the white columns of\n",
       "the porch, and wrapt in sheets of fire, like a spectral throng, the tall\n",
       "and waving trees by which it was encircled, and then as suddenly ceased,\n",
       "and \"the jaws of darkness\" devoured up the scene; he compared, with that\n",
       "bitter alchymy of feeling which resolves all into one crucible of\n",
       "thought, those alternations of sight and shadow to the history of his own\n",
       "guilty love--that passion whose birth was the womb of Night; shrouded in\n",
       "darkness, surrounded by storms, and receiving only from the angry heavens\n",
       "a momentary brilliance, more terrible than its customary gloom.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he entered the saloon, Lady Margaret advanced towards him.  \"My dear\n",
       "Falkland,\" said she, \"how good it is in you to come in such a night.  We\n",
       "have been watching the skies till Emily grew terrified at the lightning;\n",
       "formerly it did not alarm her.\"  And Lady Margaret turned, utterly\n",
       "unconscious of the reproach she had conveyed, towards Emily.\n",
       "\n",
       "Did not Falkland's look turn also to that spot?  Lady Emily was sitting\n",
       "by the harp which Mrs. St. John appeared to be most seriously employed\n",
       "in tuning: her countenance was bent downwards, and burning beneath the\n",
       "blushes called forth by the gaze which she felt was upon her.\n",
       "\n",
       "There was in Falkland's character a peculiar dislike to all outward\n",
       "display of less worldly emotions.  He had none of the vanity most men\n",
       "have in conquest; he would not have had any human being know that he was\n",
       "loved.  He was right!  No altar should be so unseen and inviolable as the\n",
       "human heart!  He saw at once and relieved the embarrassment he had\n",
       "caused.  With the remarkable fascination and grace of manner so\n",
       "peculiarly his own, he made his excuses to Lady Margaret of his\n",
       "disordered dress; he charmed his uncle, Don Alphonso, with a quotation\n",
       "from Lope de Vega; he inquired tenderly of Mrs. Dalton touching the\n",
       "health of her Italian greyhound; and then, nor till then--he ventured to\n",
       "approach Emily, and speak to her in that soft tone, which, like a fairy\n",
       "language, is understood only by the person it addresses.  Mrs. St.  John\n",
       "rose and left the harp; Falkland took her seat.  He bent down to whisper\n",
       "Emily.  His long hair touched her cheek! it was still wet with the night\n",
       "dew.  She looked up as she felt it, and met his gaze: better had it been\n",
       "to have lost earth than to have drunk the soul's poison from that eye\n",
       "when it tempted to sin.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. St. John stood at some distance: Don Alphonso was speaking to her\n",
       "of his nephew, and of his hopes of ultimately gaining him to the cause\n",
       "of his mother's country.  \"See you not,\" said Mrs. St. John, and her\n",
       "colour went and came, \"that while he has such attractions to detain him,\n",
       "your hopes are in vain?\"  \"What mean you?\"  replied the Spaniard; but his\n",
       "eye had followed the direction she had given it, and the question came\n",
       "only from his lips.  Mrs. St. John drew him to a still remoter corner of\n",
       "the room, and it was in the conversation that then ensued between them,\n",
       "that they agreed to unite for the purpose of separating Emily from her\n",
       "lover--\"I to save my friend,\" said Mrs. St. John, \"and you your kinsman.\"\n",
       "Thus is it with human virtue:--the fair show and the good deed\n",
       "without--the one eternal motive of selfishness within.  During the\n",
       "Spaniard's visit at E------, he had seen enough of Falkland to perceive\n",
       "the great consequence he might, from his perfect knowledge of the Spanish\n",
       "language, from his singular powers, and, above all, from his command of\n",
       "wealth, be to the cause of that party he himself had adopted.  His aim,\n",
       "therefore, was now no longer confined to procuring Falkland's goodwill\n",
       "and aim at home: he hoped to secure his personal assistance in Spain: and\n",
       "he willingly coincided with Mrs. St. John in detaching his nephew from a\n",
       "tie so likely to detain him from that service to which Alphonso wished he\n",
       "should be pledged.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mandeville had left E------ that morning: he suspected nothing of Emily's\n",
       "attachment.  This, on his part, was Bulwer, less confidence than\n",
       "indifference.  He was one of those persons who have no existence separate\n",
       "from their own: his senses all turned inwards; they reproduced\n",
       "selfishness.  Even the House of Commons was only an object of interest,\n",
       "because he imagined it a part of him, not he of it.  He said, with the\n",
       "insect on the wheel, \"Admire our rapidity.\"  But did the defects of his\n",
       "character remove Lady Emily's guilt?  No! and this, at times, was her\n",
       "bitterest conviction.  Whoever turns to these pages for an apology for\n",
       "sin will be mistaken.  They contain the burning records of its\n",
       "sufferings, its repentance, and its doom.  If there be one crime in\n",
       "the history of woman worse than another, it is adultery.  It is, in fact,\n",
       "the only crime to which, in ordinary life, she is exposed.  Man has a\n",
       "thousand temptations to sin--woman has but one; if she cannot resist it,\n",
       "she has no claim upon our mercy.  The heavens are just!  Her own guilt is\n",
       "her punishment!  Should these pages, at this moment, meet the eyes of one\n",
       "who has become the centre of a circle of disgrace--the contaminator of\n",
       "her house--the dishonour of her children,--no matter what the excuse for\n",
       "her crime--no matter what the exchange of her station--in the very arms\n",
       "of her lover, in the very cincture of the new ties which she has chosen\n",
       "--I call upon her to answer me if the fondest moments of rapture are free\n",
       "from humiliation, though they have forgotten remorse; and if the passion\n",
       "itself of her lover has not become no less the penalty than the\n",
       "recompense of her guilt?  But at that hour of which I now write, there\n",
       "was neither in Emily's heart, nor in that of her seducer, any\n",
       "recollection of their sin.  Those hearts were too full for thought--they\n",
       "had forgotten everything but each other.  Their love was their creation:\n",
       "beyond all was night--chaos--nothing!\n",
       "\n",
       "Lady Margaret approached them.  \"You will sing to us, Emily, to-night?\n",
       "it is so long since we have heard you!\"  It was in vain that Emily tried\n",
       "--her voice failed.  She looked at Falkland, and could scarcely restrain\n",
       "her tears.  She had not yet learned the latest art which sin teaches\n",
       "us-its concealment!  \"I will supply Lady Emily's place,\" said Falkland.\n",

       "him to learn.  \"Will you play the air,\" he said to Mrs. St.  John, \"that\n",

       "breath stole over it, and her bosom heaved beneath the arm which\n",
       "encircled that empire so devoted to him.  \"Speak one word, only one\n",

       "Write a formal, reflective paragraph in a literary style that explores the relationship between human perception and the natural world. The tone should be serious and philosophical, with a focus on the interplay between individual experience and the grandeur of nature. Begin with a solitary figure leaving a group to walk alongside a dynamic, flowing stream. Introduce a philosophical idea about how nature’s conflicts make humans feel small, but then argue that this is only partially true. Explain that the human mind derives its ideas and emotional tone from the objects it perceives, and that immersing oneself in nature’s elements can elevate the spirit, awakening deep thoughts and emotions. Use elevated, sophisticated vocabulary and complex sentence structures to convey the depth of the ideas. Include a metaphor or analogy comparing the individual’s experience in nature to the way people lose themselves in a crowd, emphasizing how nature’s vastness can dissolve the sense of self. Aim for a paragraph of similar length to the original, with a balance of descriptive imagery and philosophical reflection."

       "only a flickering light showed through the cracks.  She was restless and\n",

       "the cracks in the shutters of the tailor-shop and find out what was going\n",
       "on within.  This was indignantly rejected by Rosalie, but the more she\n",

       "remarks, and he at last relapsed into gloom, and said that he was tired\n",
       "and would go to bed.  Thereupon she wheeled him inside his bedroom, bade\n",
       "him good-night, and left him to his moodiness, which, however, was soon\n",

       "a signal pass between old Louis and Filion Lacasse, would it not be a\n",
       "humane thing to do?  It might be foolish and feminine to be anxious, but\n",

       "maybe.  Instantly her heart overflowed with sympathy.  Monsieur was not a\n",
       "Catholic perhaps?  Well, so much the more he should be befriended, for he\n",

       "\n",
       "She crossed the street quickly, hurried round the corner of the house,\n",

       "\n",
       "But presently she started back with a smothered cry.  There by the great\n",
       "fireplace stood Louis Trudel picking up a red-hot cross with a pair of\n",
       "pincers.  Grasping the iron firmly just below the arms of the cross, the\n",
       "tailor held it up again.  He looked at it with a wild triumph, yet with a\n",
       "malignancy little in keeping with the object he held--the holy relic he\n",
       "had stolen from the door of the parish church.  The girl gave a low cry\n",
       "of dismay.\n",
       "\n",
       "She saw old Louis advance stealthily towards the door of the shop leading\n",
       "into the house.  In bewilderment, she stood still an instant, then, with\n",
       "a sudden impulse, she ran to the kitchen-door and tried it softly.  It\n",
       "was not locked.  She opened it, entered quickly, and found old Margot\n",
       "standing in the middle of the room in her night-dress.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, Rosalie, Rosalie!\" cried the old woman, \"something's going to\n",
       "happen.  M'sieu' Trudel has been queer all evening.  I peeped in the key-\n",
       "hole of the shop just now, and--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, yes, I've seen too.  Come!\" said Rosalie, and going quickly to the\n",

       "another door, leading into the hall between the shop and the house.\n",
       "Entering the hall, she saw a glimmer of light above.  It was the reddish\n",
       "glow of the iron cross held by old Louis.  She crept softly up the stone\n",
       "steps.  She heard a door open very quietly.  She hurried now, and came to\n",
       "the landing.  She saw the door of Charley's room open--all the village\n",
       "knew what room he slept in--and the moonlight was streaming in at the\n",
       "window.\n",
       "\n",
       "She saw the sleeping man on the bed, and the tailor standing over him.\n",
       "Charley was lying with one arm thrown above his head; the other lay over\n",
       "the side of the bed.\n",
       "\n",
       "As she rushed forward, divining old Louis' purpose, the fiery cross\n",
       "descended, and a voice cried: \"'Show me a sign from Heaven, tailor-man!'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This voice was drowned by that of another, which, gasping with agony out\n",
       "of a deep sleep, as the body sprang upright, cried: \"God-oh God!\"\n",

       "Rosalie paid no heed to the fallen man.  \"Oil!  flour!  Quick!\" she\n",

       "\n",
       "With oil and flour she hurried back, over the body of the tailor, up the\n",

       "\"Good Mademoiselle!\" he said.\n",

       "\"Now not a word of what he did to me, remember.  Not one word, or you\n",
       "will go to jail with him.  If you keep quiet, I'll say nothing.  He\n",

       "this, please,\" he moaned.  \"Hide the cross.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He moved towards the door.  Rosalie saw his purpose, and ran out ahead of\n",
       "him and down the stairs to where the tailor lay prone on his face, one\n",
       "hand still holding the pincers.  The little iron cross lay in a dark\n",
       "corner.  Stooping, she lifted up the tailor's head, then felt his heart.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He is not dead,\" she cried.  \"Quick, Margot, some water,\" she added, to\n",

       "Twenty minutes later the tailor was lying in his bed, breathing, but\n",
       "still unconscious, the Notary, M'sieu', and the doctor of the next\n",
       "parish, who by chance was in Chaudiere, beside him.  Charley's face was\n",
       "drawn and haggard with pain, for he had helped to carry old Louis to bed,\n",
       "though every motion of his arms gave him untold agony.  In the doorway\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Will he live?\" asked the Notary.\n",
       "\n",
       "The doctor shook his head.  \"A few hours, perhaps.  He fell downstairs?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Charley nodded.  There was silence for some time, as the doctor went on\n",
       "with his ministrations, and the Notary sat drumming his fingers on the\n",
       "little table beside the bed.  The two women stole away to the kitchen,\n",
       "where Rosalie again pressed secrecy on Margot.  In the interest of the\n",
       "cause she had even threatened Margot with a charge of complicity.  She\n",
       "had heard the phrase \"accessory before the fact,\" and she used it now\n",
       "with good effect.\n",
       "\n",
       "Then she took some fresh flour and oil, and thrust them inside the\n",

       "to the neck.\n",
       "\n",
       "Nearly an hour passed, and then the Cure appeared.  When he entered the\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Peace be to this house!\" said the Cure.  He had a few minutes of\n",

       "\"He fell down-stairs, Monsieur?  You saw him fall?\"\n",

       "\"He appeared to be feeble, and he seemed moody.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"More than usual, Monsieur?\"  The Cure had heard of the incident of the\n",

       "\"Rather more than usual, Monsieur.\"\n",

       "good girl, and kind to me,\" she whimpered.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Cure seemed satisfied, and after looking at the sick man for a\n",
       "moment, he came close to Charley.  \"I am deeply pained at what happened\n",
       "to-day,\" he said courteously.  \"I know you have had nothing to do with\n",

       "\n",
       "All at once the Cure laid a hand upon his arm.  \"You are ill,\" he said\n",

       "doctor, \"you have another patient here!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The friendly, oleaginous doctor came over and peered into Charley's face.\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Charley bowed, but did not move.  Just then two things drew the attention\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Go and tell them no one must come up,\" said the doctor to the Notary,\n",

       "\n",
       "Presently the noise below-stairs diminished, and the priest's voice rose\n",
       "in the office, vibrating and touching.  The two women sank to their\n",
       "knees, the doctor followed, his eyes still fixed on the dying man.\n",

       "He gasped and was convulsed, but the pallor of his face was alive with\n",
       "fire from the distempered eyes.  He snatched from his breast the paper\n",
       "Charley had neglected to burn.  He thrust it into the Curb's hand.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "His strength failed him, his hand clutched tremblingly at the air.  He\n",

       "a guardian of the fold--a family of faithful Catholics whose thoughts\n",
       "never strayed into forbidden realms.  He had done no more than keep them\n",

       "baptising, and burying, giving in marriage and blessing, sending them on\n",
       "their last great journey with the cachet of Holy Church upon them.  But\n",
       "never once, never in all his life, had he brought a lost soul into the\n",
       "fold.  If he died to-night, he could not say to St. Peter, when he\n",
       "arrived at Heaven's gate: \"See, I have saved a soul!\"  Before\n",
       "the Throne he could not say to Him who cried: \"Go ye into all the world\n",
       "and preach the gospel to every creature\"--he could not say: \"Lord,\n",
       "by Thy grace I found this soul in the wilderness, in the dark and the\n",

       "had been governed by habit, which was lightly coloured by temperament.\n",
       "Since the eventful hour on Vadrome Mountain it had become a life of\n",
       "temperament, in which habit was involuntary and mechanical.  She did her\n",
       "daily duties with a good heart, but also with a sense superior to the\n",
       "practical action.  This grew from day to day, until, in the tragical days\n",
       "wherein she had secretly played a great part, she moved as in a dream,\n",
       "but a dream so formal that no one saw any change taking place in her,\n",
       "or associated her with the events happening across the way.\n",
       "\n",

       "with being an infidel?  At first she was ill disposed to answer any\n",

       "a devout Catholic, and a constant friend of the Cure.  He it was who,\n",
       "when an effort was made to drive Paulette out of the parish, had said\n",
       "that she should not go unless she wished; that, having been born in\n",
       "Chaudiere, she had a right to live there and die there; and if she had\n",
       "sinned there, the parish was in some sense to blame.  Though he had no\n",
       "lodge-gates, and though the seigneury was but a great wide low-roofed\n",
       "farmhouse, with an observatory, and a chimney-piece dating from the time\n",
       "of Louis the Fourteenth, the Seigneur gave Paulette Dubois a little hut\n",
       "at his outer gate, which had been there since the great Count Frontenac\n",
       "visited Chaudiere.  Probably Rosalie spoke to Paulette Dubois more often\n",
       "than did any one else in the parish, but that was because the woman came\n",
       "for little things at the shop, and asked for letters, and every week sent\n",
       "one--to a man living in Montreal.  She sent these letters, but not more\n",
       "than once in six months did she get a reply, and she had not had one in\n",
       "a whole year.  Yet every week she asked, and Rosalie found it hard to\n",
       "answer her politely, and sometimes showed it.\n",
       "\n",
       "So it was that the two disliked each other without good cause, save that\n",
       "they were separated by a chasm as wide as a sea.  The one disliked the\n",
       "other because she must recognise her; the other chafed because she could\n",

       "The late afternoon of the day in which Rosalie decided to nail the cross\n",
       "on the church door again, Paulette arrived to ask for letters at the\n",
       "moment that the office wicket was closed, and Rosalie had answered that\n",
       "it was after office hours, and had almost closed the door in her face.\n",
       "As she turned away Jo Portugais came out of the tailor-shop opposite.  He\n",
       "saw Paulette, and stood still an instant.  She did the same.  A strange\n",

       "opposite directions.\n",
       "\n",
       "Never in her life had time gone so slowly with Rosalie.  She watched the\n",

       "tried to read--it was no use; she tried to spin-her fingers trembled; she\n",
       "sorted the letters in the office again, and rearranged every letter and\n",
       "parcel and paper in its little pigeonhole--then did it all over again.\n",
       "She took out again the letter Paulette had dropped in the letter-box; it\n",
       "was addressed in the name of the man at Montreal.  She looked at it in a\n",
       "kind of awe, as she had ever done the letters of this woman who was\n",
       "without the pale.  They had a sense of mystery, an air of forbidden\n",
       "imagination.\n",
       "\n",
       "She put the letter back, went to the door again, and looked out.  It was\n",
       "now time to go.  Drawing a hood over her head, she stepped out into the\n",
       "night.  There was a little frost, though spring was well forward, and the\n",
       "smell of the rich earth and the budding trees was sweet to the sense.\n",
       "The moon had just set, but the stars were shining, and here and there\n",
       "patches of snow on the hillside and in the fields added to the light.\n",
       "Yet it was not bright enough to see far, and as Rosalie moved down the\n",
       "street she did not notice a figure at a little distance behind, walking\n",
       "on the new-springing grass by the roadside.  All was quiet at the tavern;\n",
       "there was no light in the Notary's house--as a rule, he sat up late,\n",
       "reading; and even the fiddle of Maximilian Cour, the baker, was silent.\n",
       "The Cure's windows were dark, and the church with its white tin spire\n",
       "stood up sentinel-like above the village.\n",
       "\n",
       "Rosalie had the fateful cross in her hand as she softly opened the gate\n",
       "of the churchyard and approached the great oak doors.  Taking a screw-\n",
       "driver and some screws from her pocket, she felt with a finger for the\n",
       "old screw-holes in the door.  Then she began her work, looking fearfully\n",
       "round once or twice at first.  Presently, however, because the screws\n",
       "were larger than the old ones, it became much harder; the task called\n",
       "forth more strength, and drove all thought of being seen out of her mind\n",
       "for a space.  At last, however, she gave the final turn to the handle,\n",
       "and every screw was in its place, its top level and smooth with the iron\n",
       "of the cross.  She stopped and looked round again with an uneasy feeling.\n",
       "She could see no one, hear no one, but she began to tremble, and,\n",
       "overcome, she fell on her knees before the door, and, with her fingers on\n",
       "the foot of the little cross, prayed passionately; for herself, for\n",
       "Monsieur.\n",
       "\n",
       "Suddenly she heard footsteps inside the church.  They were coming towards\n",
       "the doorway, nearer and nearer.  At first she was so struck with terror\n",
       "that she could not move.  Then with a little cry she sprang to her feet,\n",
       "rushed to the gate, threw it open, ran out into the road, ind wildly on\n",
       "towards home.  She did not stop for at least three hundred yards.\n",
       "Turning and looking back she saw at the church door a pale round light.\n",
       "With another cry she sped on, and did not pause till she reached the\n",
       "house.  Then, bursting in and locking the door, she hurried to her room,\n",
       "undressed quickly, got into bed without saying her prayers, and buried\n",
       "her face in the pillow, shivering and overwrought.\n",
       "\n",
       "The footsteps she had heard were those of the Cure and Jo Portugais.  The\n",
       "Cure had sent for Jo to do some last work upon a little altar, to be used\n",
       "the next day for the first time.  The carpenter and the carver in wood\n",
       "who were responsible for the work had fallen victims to white whiskey on\n",
       "the very last day of their task, and had been driven from the church by\n",
       "the Cure, who then sent for Jo.  Rosalie had not seen the light at the\n",
       "shrine, as it was on the side of the church farthest from the village.\n",
       "\n",
       "Their labour finished, the two came towards the front door, the Cure's\n",
       "lantern in his hand.  Opening the door, Jo heard the sound of footsteps\n",
       "and saw a figure flying down the road.  As the Cure came out\n",
       "abstractedly, he glanced sorrowfully towards the place where the little\n",
       "cross was used to be.  He gave a wondering cry, and almost dropped the\n",
       "lantern.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"See, see, Portugais,\" he said, \"our little cross again!\" Jo nodded.\n",
       "\"So it seems, Monsieur,\" he said.\n",
       "\n",
       "At that instant he saw a hood lying on the ground, and as the Cure held\n",
       "up the lantern, peering at the little cross, he hastily picked it up and\n",
       "thrust it inside his coat.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Strange--very strange!\" said the Cure.  \"It must have been done while\n",
       "we were inside.  It was not there when we entered.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We entered by the vestry door,\" said Jo.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, true-true,\" responded the Cure.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It comes as it went,\" said Jo.  \"You can't account for some things.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The Cure turned and looked at Jo curiously.  \"Are you then so\n",
       "superstitious, Jo?  Nonsense; it is the work of human hands--very human\n",
       "hands,\" he added sadly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There is nothing to show,\" said the Cure, seeing Jo's glance round.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"As you see, M'sieu' le Cure.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, it is a mystery which time no doubt will clear up.  Meanwhile, let\n",
       "us be thankful to God,\" said the Cure.\n",
       "\n",
       "They parted, the Cure going through a side-gate into his own garden,\n",
       "Jo passing out of the churchyard-gate through which Rosalie had gone.\n",
       "He looked down the road towards the village.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well!\" said a voice in his ear.  Paulette Dubois stood before him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It was you, then,\" he said, with a glowering look.  \"What did you want\n",
       "with it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What do you want with the hood in your coat there?\"  She threw her head\n",
       "back with a spiteful laugh.  \"Whose do you think it is?\" he said\n",
       "quietly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You and the schoolmaster made verses about her once.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It was Rosalie Evanturel?\" he asked, with aggravating composure.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have the hood-look at it!  You saw her running down the road; I saw\n",
       "her come, watched her, and saw her go.  She is a thief--pretty Rosalie--\n",
       "thief and postmistress!  No doubt she takes letters too.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The ones you wait for, and that never come--eh?\"  Her face darkened with\n",
       "rage and hatred.  \"I will tell the world she's a thief,\" she sneered.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who will believe you?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You will.\"  She was hard and fierce, and looked him in the eyes\n",
       "squarely.  \"You'll give evidence quick enough, if I ask you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I wouldn't do anything you asked me to-nothing, if it was to save my\n",
       "life.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I'll prove her a thief without you.  She can't deny it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If you try it, I'll--\"  He stopped, husky and shaking.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You'll kill me, eh?  You killed him, and you didn't hang.  Oh no, you\n",
       "wouldn't kill me, Jo,\" she added quickly, in a changed voice.  \"You've\n",
       "had enough of that kind of thing.  If I'd been you, I'd rather have hung\n",
       "--ah, sure!\"  She suddenly came close to him.  \"Do you hate me so bad,\n",
       "Jo?\" she said anxiously.  \"It's eight years--do you hate me so bad as\n",
       "then?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You keep your tongue off Rosalie Evanturel,\" he said, and turned on his\n",
       "heel.\n",
       "\n",
       "She caught his arm.  \"We're both bad, Jo.  Can't we be friends?\" she\n",

       "\n",
       "He did not reply.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Don't drive a woman too hard,\" she said between her teeth.\n",

       "\"Threats!  Pah!\" he rejoined.  \"What do you think I'm made of?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I'll find that out,\" she said, and, turning on her heel, ran down the\n",
       "road towards the Manor House.  \"What had Rosalie to do with the cross?\"\n",

       "\n",
       "He hurried on, and as he neared the post-office he saw the figure of a\n",
       "woman in the road.  At first he thought it might be Rosalie, but as he\n",
       "came nearer he saw it was not.  The woman was muttering and crying.  She\n",

       "on the church steps viewing the scene and awaiting the approach of the\n",
       "soldier-citizens.  The Seigneur and the Cure had ceased listening to the\n",

       "oblivious to all round him.  Almost opposite the church door, however,\n",
       "Charley was suddenly stopped by Filion Lacasse, who ran out from a group\n",

       "\n",
       "\"M'sieu', it's all right.  What you said done it, sure!  I'm a thousand\n",

       "for being just what he is to-day--an infidel--an infidel!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He was going to say something else, but he did not like the look the Cure\n",

       "\n",
       "\"It's taking bread out of other men's mouths.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It put bread into Filion's mouth.  Did you ever give Lacasse advice?\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Yes, Monsieur, and sound advice too, within the law-precedent and code\n",
       "and every legal fact behind.\"  The Seigneur was a man of laconic speech.\n",
       "\"Tut, tut, Dauphin; precedent and code and legal fact are only good when\n",
       "there's brain behind 'em.  The tailor yonder has brains.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, but what does he know about the law?\" answered Dauphin, with\n",

       "the Seigneur.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Enough for the saddler evidently,\" sharply rejoined the Seigneur.\n",
       "\n",
       "Dauphin was fighting for his life, as it were.  His back was to the wall.\n",
       "If this man was to be allowed to advise the habitants of Chaudiere on\n",
       "their disputes and \"going to law,\" where would his own prestige be?\n",
       "His vanity had been deeply wounded.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It's guesswork with him.  Let him stick to his trade as I stick to mine.\n",
       "That sort of thing only does harm.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He puts a thousand dollars into the saddler's pocket: that's a positive\n",
       "good.  He may or may not take thereby ten dollars out of your pocket:\n",
       "that's a negative injury.  In this case there was no injury, for you had\n",
       "already cost Lacasse--how much had you cost him, Dauphin?\" continued the\n",
       "Seigneur, with a half-malicious smile.  \"I've been out of Chaudiere for\n",
       "near a year; I don't know the record--how much, eh, Dauphin?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The Notary was too offended to answer.  He shook his ringlets back\n",
       "angrily, and a scarlet spot showed on each straw-coloured cheek.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Twenty dollars is what Lacasse paid our dear Dauphin,\" said the Cure\n",
       "benignly, \"and a very proper charge.  Lacasse probably gave Monsieur\n",
       "there quite as much, and Monsieur will give it to the first poor man he\n",
       "meets, or send it to the first sick person of whom he hears.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My own opinion is, he's playing some game here,\" said the Notary.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We all play games,\" said the Seigneur.  \"His seems to give him hard work\n",
       "and little luxury.  Will you bring him to see me at the Manor, my dear\n",
       "Cure?\" he added.  \"He will not go.  I have asked him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then I shall visit him at his tailor-shop,\" said the Seigneur.  \"I need\n",
       "a new suit.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But you always had your clothes made in Quebec, Monsieur,\" said the\n",
       "Notary, still carping.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We never had such a tailor,\" answered the Seigneur.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We'll hear more of him before we're done with him,\" obstinately urged\n",
       "the Notary.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It would give Dauphin the greatest pleasure if our tailor proved to be a\n",
       "murderer or a robber.  I suppose you believe that he stole our little\n",
       "cross here,\" the Cure added, turning to the church door, where his eye\n",
       "lingered lovingly on the relic, hanging on a pillar just inside, whither\n",
       "he had had it removed.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I'm not sure yet he hadn't something to do with it,\" was the stubborn\n",
       "response.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If he did, may it bring him peace at last!\" said the Cure piously.\n",
       "\"I have set my heart on nailing him to our blessed faith as that cross\n",
       "is fixed to the pillar yonder--'I will fasten him like a nail in a sure\n",
       "place,' says the Book.  I take it hard that my friend Dauphin will not\n",
       "help me on the way.  Suppose the man were evil, then the Church should\n",
       "try to snatch him like a brand from the burning.  But suppose that in his\n",
       "past there was no wrong necessary to be hidden in the present--and this\n",
       "I believe with all my heart; suppose that he was wronged, not wronging:\n",
       "then how much more should the Church strive to win him to the light!\n",
       "Why, man, have you no pride in Holy Church?  I am ashamed of you,\n",
       "Dauphin, with your great intelligence, your wide reading.  With our\n",
       "knowledge of the world we should be broader.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The Seigneur's eyes were turned away, for there was in them at once\n",
       "humour and a suspicious moisture.  Of all men in the world he most\n",
       "admired the Cure, for his utter truth and nobility; but he could not\n",
       "help smiling at his enthusiasm--his dear Cure turned evangelist like any\n",
       "\"Methody\"!--and at the appeal of the Notary on the ground of knowledge\n",
       "of the world.  He was wise enough to count himself an old fogy, a\n",
       "provincial, and \"a simon-pure habitant,\" but of the three he only had any\n",
       "knowledge of life.  As men of the world the Cure and the Notary were sad\n",
       "failures, though they stood for much in Chaudiere.  Yet this detracted\n",
       "nothing from the fine gentlemanliness of the Cure or the melodramatic\n",
       "courtesy of the Notary.\n",
       "\n",
       "Amused and touched as the Seigneur had been at the Cure's words, he\n",
       "turned now and said: \"Always on the weaker side, Cure; always hoping the\n",
       "best from the worst of us.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am only following an example at my door--you taught us all charity and\n",
       "justice,\" answered M. Loisel, looking meaningly at the Seigneur.  There\n",
       "was silence a little while, for all three were thinking of the woman of\n",
       "the hut, at the gate of the Seigneur's manor.\n",
       "\n",
       "On this topic M. Dauphin was not voluble.  His original kindness to the\n",
       "woman had given him many troubled hours at home, for Madame Dauphin had\n",
       "construed his human sympathy into the dark and carnal desires of the\n",
       "heart, and his truthful eloquence had made his case the worse.  A\n",
       "miserable sentimentalist, the Notary was likely to be misunderstood for\n",
       "ever, and one or two indiscretions of his extreme youth had been a weapon\n",
       "against him through the long years of a blameless married life.\n",
       "\n",
       "He heaved a sigh of sympathy with the Cure now.  \"She has not come back\n",
       "yet?\" he said to the Seigneur.  \"No sign of her.  She locked up and\n",
       "stepped out, so my housekeeper says, about the time--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The day of old Margot's funeral,\" interposed the Notary.  \"She'd had a\n",
       "letter that day, a letter she'd been waiting for, and abroad she went--\n",
       "alas! the flyaway--from bad to worse, I fear--ah me!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The Seigneur turned sharply on him.  \"Who told you she had a letter that\n",
       "day, for which she had been waiting?\" he said.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Monsieur Evanturel.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The Seigneur's face became sterner still.  \"What business had he to know\n",
       "that she received a letter that day?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He is postmaster,\" innocently replied the Notary.  \"He is the devil!\"\n",
       "said the Seigneur tartly.  \"I beg your pardon, Cure; but it is\n",
       "Evanturel's business not to know what letters go to and fro in that\n",
       "office.  He should be blind and dumb, so far as we all are concerned.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Remember that Evanturel is a cripple,\" the Cure answered gently.  \"I am\n",
       "glad, very glad it was not Rosalie.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Rosalie has more than usual sense for her sex,\" gruffly but kindly\n",
       "answered the Seigneur, a look of friendliness in his eyes.  \"I shall talk\n",
       "to her about her father; I can't trust myself to speak to the man.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Rosalie is down there with Madame Dauphin,\" said the Notary, pointing.\n",
       "\"Shall I ask her to come?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The Seigneur nodded.  He was magistrate and magnate, and he was the\n",
       "guarantor of the post-office, and of Rosalie and her father.  His eyes\n",
       "fixed in reverie on Rosalie; he and the Cure passively waited her\n",
       "approach.\n",
       "\n",
       "She came over, pale and a little anxious, but with a courageous look.\n",
       "She had a vague sense of trouble, and she feared it might be the little\n",
       "cross, that haunting thing of all these months.\n",
       "\n",
       "When she came near, the Cure greeted her courteously, and then, taking\n",
       "the Notary by the arm, led him away.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Seigneur and Rosalie being left alone, the girl said: \"You wish to\n",
       "speak with me, Monsieur?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The Seigneur scrutinised her sharply.  Though her colour came and went,\n",
       "her look was frank and fearless.  She had had many dark hours since that\n",
       "fateful month of April.  At night, trying to sleep, she had heard the\n",
       "ghostly footsteps in the church, which had sent her flying homeward.\n",
       "Then, there was the hood.  She had waited on and on, fearing word would\n",
       "come that it had been found in the churchyard, and that she had been seen\n",
       "putting the cross back upon the church door.  As day after day passed she\n",
       "had come at length to realise that, whatever had happened to the hood,\n",
       "she was not suspected.  Yet the whole train of circumstances had a\n",
       "supernatural air, for the Cure and Jo Portugais had not made public their\n",
       "experience on the eventful night; she had been educated in a land of\n",
       "legend and superstition, and a deep impression had been made upon her\n",
       "mind, giving to her other new emotions a touch of pathos, of imagination,\n",
       "and adding character to her face.  The old Seigneur stroked his chin as\n",
       "he looked at her.  He realised that a change had come upon her, that she\n",
       "had developed in some surprising way.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What has happened--who has happened, Mademoiselle Rosalie?\" he asked.\n",
       "He had suddenly made up his mind about that look in her face--he thought\n",
       "it the woman in her which answers to the call of man, not perhaps any\n",
       "particular man, but man the attractive influence, the complement.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her eyes dropped, then raised frankly to his.  \"I don't know,\"--adding,\n",
       "with a quick humour, for he had been very friendly with her, and joked\n",
       "with her in his dry way all her life; \"do you, Monsieur?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He pulled his nose with a quick gesture habitual to him, and answered\n",
       "slowly and meaningly: \"The government's a good husband and pays regular\n",
       "wages, Mademoiselle.  I'd stick to government.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am not asking for a divorce, Monsieur.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He pulled his nose again delightedly--so many people were pathetically\n",
       "in earnest in Chaudiere--even the Cure's humour was too mediaeval and\n",
       "obvious.  He had never before thought Rosalie so separate from them all.\n",
       "All at once he had a new interest in her.  His cheek flushed a little,\n",
       "his eye kindled, humour relaxed his lips.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No other husband would intrude so little,\" he rejoined.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"True, there's little love lost between us, Monsieur.\"  She felt\n",
       "exhilaration in talking with him, a kind of joy in measuring word against\n",
       "word; yet a year ago she would have done no more than smile respectfully\n",
       "and give a demure reply if the Seigneur had spoken to her like this.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Seigneur noted the mixed emotions in her face and the delicate\n",
       "alertness of expression.  As a man of the world, he was inclined to\n",
       "believe that only one kind of experience can bring such looks to a\n",
       "woman's face.  He saw in her the awakening of the deeper interests of\n",
       "life, the tremulous apprehension of nascent emotions and passions which,\n",
       "at some time or other, give beauty and importance to the nature of every\n",
       "human being.  It did not occur to him that the tailor--the mysterious\n",
       "figure in the parish--might be responsible.  He was observant, but not\n",
       "imaginative; he was moved by what he saw, in a quiet, unexplainable\n",
       "manner.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The government is the best sort of husband.  From the other sort you\n",
       "would get more kisses and less ha'pence,\" he continued.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That might be a satisfactory balance-sheet, Monsieur.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Take care, Mademoiselle Rosalie,\" he rejoined, half seriously, \"that you\n",
       "don't miss the ha'pence before you get the kisses.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She turned pale in very fear.  What was he going to say?  Was the post-\n",
       "office to be taken from them?  She came straight to the point.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What have I done wrong, Monsieur?  I've never kept the mail-stage\n",
       "waiting; I've never left the mailbag unlocked; I've never been late in\n",
       "opening the wicket; I've never been careless, and no one's ever\n",
       "complained of a lost letter.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The Seigneur saw her agitation, and was sorry for her.  He came to the\n",
       "point as she had done:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We will have you made postmistress--you alone, Rosalie Evanturel.  I've\n",
       "made up my mind to that.  But you'll promise not to get married--eh?\n",
       "Anyhow, there's no one in the parish for you to marry.  You're too well-\n",
       "born and you've been too well educated for a habitant's wife--and the\n",
       "Cure or I can't marry you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He was not taken back to see her flush deeply, and it pleased him to see\n",
       "this much life rising to his own touch, this much revelation to give his\n",
       "mind a new interest.  He had come to that age when the mind is surprised\n",
       "to find that the things that once charmed charm less, and the things once\n",
       "hated are less acutely repulsive.  He saw her embarrassment.  He did not\n",
       "know that this was the first time that she had ever thought of marriage\n",
       "since it ceased to be a dream of girlhood, and, by reason of thinking\n",
       "much on a man, had become a possibility, which, however, she had never\n",
       "confessed to herself.  Here she was faced by it now in the broad open\n",
       "day: a plain, hard statement, unrelieved by aught save the humour of the\n",
       "shrewd eyes bent upon her.\n",
       "\n",
       "She did not answer him at once.  \"Do you promise not to marry so useless\n",
       "a thing as man, and to remain true to the government?\" he continued.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If I wished to marry a man, I should not let the government stand in my\n",
       "way,\" she said, in brave confusion.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But do you wish to marry any man?\" he asked abruptly, even petulantly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have not asked myself that question, Monsieur, and--should you ask it,\n",
       "unless--\" she said, and paused with as pretty and whimsical a glance of\n",
       "merriment as could well be.\n",
       "\n",
       "He burst out laughing at the swift turn she had given her reply, and at\n",
       "the double suggestion.  Then he suddenly changed.  A curious expression\n",
       "filled his eyes.  A smile, almost beautiful, came to his lips.\n",

       "THE SEIGNEUR GIVES A WARNING\n",
       "\n",
       "Rosalie had watched a shut door for five days--a door from which, for\n",
       "months past, had come all the light and glow of her life.  It framed a\n",
       "figure which had come to represent to her all that meant hope and soul\n",
       "and conscience-and love.  The morning after St. Jean Baptiste's day she\n",
       "had awaited the opening door, but it had remained closed.  Ensued\n",
       "watchful hours, and then from Jo Portugais she had learned that M'sieu'\n",
       "had been ill and near to death.  She had been told the weird story of the\n",
       "medicine-man and the ghostly voice, and, without reason, she took the\n",
       "incident as a warning, and associated it with the man across the way.\n",
       "She was come of a superstitious race, and she herself had heard and seen\n",
       "things of which she never had been able to speak--the footsteps in the\n",
       "church the night she had screwed the little cross to the door again; the\n",
       "tiny round white light by the door of the church; the hood which had\n",
       "vanished into the unknown.  One mystery fed another.  It seemed to her as\n",
       "if some dreadful event were forward; and all day she kept her eyes fixed\n",
       "on the tailor's door.\n",
       "\n",
       "Dead--if M'sieu' should die!  If M'sieu' should die--it needed all her\n",
       "will to prevent herself from going over and taking things in her own\n",
       "hands, being his nurse, his handmaid, his slave.  Duty--to the\n",
       "government, to her father?  Her heart cried out that her duty lay where\n",
       "all her life was eddying to one centre.  What would the world say?  She\n",
       "was not concerned for that, save for him.  What, then, would M'sieu' say?\n",
       "That gave her pause.  The Seigneur's words the day before had driven her\n",
       "back upon a tide of emotions which carried her far out upon that sea\n",
       "where reason and life's conventions are derelicts, where Love sails with\n",
       "reckless courage down the shoreless main.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If I could only be near him!\" she kept saying to herself.  \"It is my\n",
       "right.  I would give my life, my soul for his.  I was with him before\n",
       "when his life was in danger.  It was my hand that saved him.  It was my\n",
       "love that tended him.  It was my soul that kept his secret.  It was my\n",
       "faith that spoke for him.  It was my heart that ached for him.  It is my\n",
       "heart that aches for him now as none other in all the world can.  No one\n",
       "on earth could care as I care.  Who could there be?\"  Something whispered\n",
       "in her ear, \"Kathleen!\"  The name haunted her, as the little cross had\n",
       "done.  Misery and anger possessed her, and she fought on with herself\n",
       "through dark hours.\n",
       "\n",
       "Thus five days had gone, until at last a wagon was brought to the door of\n",
       "the tailor-shop, and M'sieu' came out, leaning on the arm of Jo\n",
       "Portugais.  There were several people in the street at the time, and they\n",
       "kept whispering that M'sieu' had been at death's door.  He was pale and\n",
       "haggard, with dark hollows under the eyes.  Just as he got into the wagon\n",
       "the Cure came up.  They shook hands.  The Cure looked him earnestly in\n",
       "the face, his lips moved, but no one could have told what he said.  As\n",
       "the wagon started, Charley looked across to the post-office.  Rosalie was\n",
       "standing a little back from the door, but she stepped forward now.  Their\n",
       "eyes met.  Her heart beat faster, for there was a look in his eyes she\n",
       "had never seen before--a look of human helplessness, of deep anxiety.  It\n",
       "was meant for her--for herself alone.  She could not trust herself to go\n",
       "and speak to him.  She felt that she must burst into tears.  So, with a\n",
       "look of pity and pain, she watched the wagon go down the street.\n",
       "\n",
       "Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat!--the Seigneur's gold-headed cane rattled on the\n",
       "front door of the tailor-shop.  It was plain to be seen his business was\n",
       "urgent.\n",
       "\n",
       "Madame Dauphin came hurrying from the postoffice, followed by Maximilian\n",
       "Cour and Filion Lacasse.  \"Ah, M'sieu', the tailor will not answer.\n",
       "There's no use knocking--not a bit, M'sieu' Rossignol,\" said Madame.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Seigneur turned querulously upon the Notary's wife, yet with a glint\n",
       "of hard humour in his eye.  He had no love for Madame Dauphin.  He\n",
       "thought she took unfair advantages of M. Dauphin, whom also he did not\n",
       "love, but whose temperament did him credit.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How should Madame know whether or no the gentleman will answer?  Does\n",
       "Madame share the gentleman's confidence, perhaps?\" he remarked.\n",
       "\n",
       "Madame did not reply at once.  She turned on the saddler and the baker.\n",
       "\"I hope you'll learn a lesson,\" she cried triumphantly.  \"I've always\n",
       "said the tailor was quite the gentleman; and now you see how your betters\n",
       "call him.  No, M'sieu', the gentleman will not answer,\" she added to the\n",
       "Seigneur.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He is in bed yet, Madame?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"His bed is empty there, M'sieu',\" she said, impressively, and pointing.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I suppose I should trust you in this matter; I suppose you should know.\n",
       "But, Dauphin--what does Dauphin say?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The saddler laughed outright.  Maximilian Cour suddenly blushed in\n",
       "sympathy with Madame Dauphin, who now saw the drift of the Seigneur's\n",
       "remarks, and was sensibly agitated, as the Seigneur had meant her to be.\n",
       "Had she not turned Dauphin's human sympathies into a crime?  Had not the\n",
       "Notary supported the Seigneur in his friendly offices to Paulette Dubois;\n",
       "and had not Madame troubled her husband's life because of it?  Madame\n",
       "bridled up now--with discretion, for it was not her cue to offend the\n",
       "Seigneur.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"All the village knows his bed's empty there, M'sieu',\" she said, with\n",
       "tightening lips.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am subtracted from the total, then?\" he asked drily.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have been away for the last five days--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Come, now, how did you know that?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Everybody knows it.  You went away with the Colonel and the soldiers on\n",
       "St.  Jean Baptiste's day.  Since then M'sieu' the tailor has been ill.  I\n",
       "should think Mrs. Flynn would have told you that, M'sieu'.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"H'm!  Would you?  Well, Mrs. Flynn has been away too--and you didn't\n",
       "know that!  What is the matter with Monsieur Mallard?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Some kind of fever.  On St. Jean Baptiste's day he was taken ill, and\n",
       "that animal Portugais took care of him all night--I wonder how M'sieu'\n",
       "can have the creature about!  That St. Jean Baptiste's night was an awful\n",
       "night.  Have you heard of what happened, M'sieu'?  Ghost or no ghost--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Come, come, I want to know about the tailor, not of ghosts,\" impatiently\n",
       "interrupted the Seigneur.  \"Tiens!  M'sieu', the tailor was ill for three\n",
       "days here, and he would let no one except the Cure and Jo Portugais near\n",
       "him.  I went myself to clean up and make some broth, but that toad of a\n",
       "Portugais shut the door in my face.  The Cure told us to go home and\n",
       "leave M'sieu' with Portugais.  He must be very sick to have that black\n",
       "sheep about him--and no doctor either.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The saddler spoke up now.  \"I took him a bottle of good brandy and some\n",
       "buttermilk-pop and seed cake--I would give him a saddle if he had a\n",
       "horse--he got my thousand dollars for me!  Well, he took them, but what\n",
       "do you think?  He sent them right off to the shantyman, Gugon, who has a\n",
       "broken leg.  Infidel or no, I'm on his side for sure.  And God blesses a\n",
       "cheerful giver, I'm told.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was the baker's chance, and he took it.  \"I played 'The Heart Bowed\n",
       "Down'-it is English-under his window, two nights ago, and he sent word\n",
       "for me to come and play it again in the kitchen.  Ah, that is a good\n",
       "song, 'The Heart Bowed Down.'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You'd be a better baker if you fiddled less,\" said Madame Dauphin,\n",
       "annoyed at being dropped out of the conversation.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The soul must be fed, Madame,\" rejoined the baker, with asperity.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Where is the tailor now?\" said the Seigneur shortly.  \"At Portugais's\n",
       "on Vadrome Mountain.  They say he looked like a ghost when he went.\n",
       "Rosalie Evanturel saw him, but she has no tongue in her head this\n",
       "morning,\" added Madame.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Seigneur moved away.  \"Good-bye to you--I am obliged to you, Madame.\n",
       "Good-bye, Lacasse.  Come and fiddle to me some night, Cour.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He bowed to the obsequious three, and then bent his steps towards the\n",
       "post-office.  They seemed about to follow him, but he stopped them with a\n",
       "look.  The men raised their bonnets-rouges, the woman bowed low, and the\n",
       "Seigneur entered the post-office door.\n",
       "\n",
       "From the shadows of the office Rosalie had watched the little group\n",
       "before the door of the tailor-shop.  She saw the Seigneur coming across\n",
       "the street.  Suddenly she flushed deeply, for there came to her mind the\n",
       "song the quack-doctor sang:\n",
       "\n",
       "                        \"Voila, the day has come\n",

       "                         With fear she walks in the sun,\n",
       "                         For Raoul is ninety year,\n",
       "                         And she not twenty-one.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "As M. Rossignol's figure darkened the doorway, she pretended to be busy\n",
       "behind the wicket, and not to see him.  He was not sure, but he thought\n",
       "it quite possible that she had seen him coming, and he put her\n",
       "embarrassment down to shyness.  Naturally the poor child was not given\n",
       "the chance every day to receive an offer of marriage from a seigneur.\n",
       "He had made up his mind that she would be sure to accept him if he asked\n",
       "her a second time.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, Ma'm'selle Rosalie,\" he said gaily, \"what have you to say that you\n",
       "should not come before a magistrate at once?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nothing, if Monsieur Rossignol is to be the magistrate,\" she replied,\n",
       "with forced lightness.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Good!\"  He looked at her quizzically through his gold-handled glass.\n",
       "\"I can't frighten you, I see.  Well, you must wait a little; you shall be\n",
       "sworn in postmistress in three days.\"  His voice lowered, became more\n",
       "serious.  \"Tell me,\" he said, \"do you know what is the matter with the\n",
       "gentleman across the way?\"  Turning, he looked across to the tailor-shop,\n",
       "as though he expected \"the gentleman\" to appear, and he did not see her\n",
       "turn pale.  When his look fell on her again, she was self-controlled.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do not know, Monsieur.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have been opposite him here these months past--did you ever see\n",
       "anything not--not as it should be?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"With him, Monsieur?  Never.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is as though the infidel behaved like a good Catholic and a\n",
       "Christian?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There are good Catholics in Chaudiere who do not behave like\n",
       "Christians.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What would you say, for instance, about his past?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What should I say about his past, Monsieur?  What should I know?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You should know more than any one else in Chaudiere.  The secrets of his\n",
       "breast might well be bared to you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She started and crimsoned.  Before her eyes there came a mist obscuring\n",
       "the Seigneur, and for an instant shutting out the world.  The secrets of\n",
       "his breast--what did he mean?  Did he know that on Monsieur's breast was\n",
       "the red scar which .  .  .\n",
       "\n",
       "M. Rossignol's voice seemed coming from an infinite distance, and as it\n",
       "came, the mist slowly passed from her eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You will know, Mademoiselle Rosalie,\" he was saying, \"that while I\n",
       "suggested that the secrets of his breast might well be bared to you, I\n",
       "meant that as an honest lady and faithful postmistress they were not.  It\n",
       "was my awkward joke--a stupid gambolling by an old man who ought to know\n",
       "better.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She did not answer, and he continued:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You know that you are trusted.  Pray accept my apologies.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She was herself again.  \"Monsieur,\" she said quietly; \"I know nothing of\n",
       "his past.  I want to know nothing.  It does not seem to me that it is my\n",
       "business.  The world is free for a man to come and go in, if he keeps the\n",
       "law and does no ill--is it not?  But, in any case, I know nothing.  Since\n",
       "you have said so much, I shall say this, and betray no 'secrets of his\n",
       "breast'--that he has received no letter through this office since the day\n",
       "he first came from Vadrome Mountain.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The Seigneur smiled.  \"A wonderful tailor!  How does he carry on business\n",
       "without writing letters?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There was a large stock of everything left by Louis Trudel, and not long\n",
       "ago a commercial traveller was here with everything.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You think he has nothing to hide, then?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Have not we all something to hide--with or without shame?\" she asked\n",
       "simply.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have more sense than any woman in Chaudiere, Mademoiselle.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She shook her head, yet she raised her eyes gratefully to him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I put faith in what you say,\" he continued.  \"Now listen.  My brother,\n",
       "the Abbe, chaplain to the Archbishop, is coming here.  He has heard of\n",
       "'the infidel' of our parish.  He is narrow and intolerant--the Abbe.  He\n",
       "is going to stir up trouble against the tailor.  We are a peaceful people\n",
       "here, and like to be left alone.  We are going on very well as we are.\n",
       "So I wanted to talk to Monsieur to-day.  I must make up my own mind how\n",
       "to act.  The tailor-shop is the property of the Church.  An infidel\n",
       "occupies it, so it is said; the Abbe does not like that.  I believe there\n",
       "are other curious suspicions about Monsieur: that he is a robber, or\n",
       "incendiary, or something of the sort.  The Abbe may take a stand, and the\n",
       "Cure's position will be difficult.  What is more, my brother has friends\n",
       "here, fanatics like himself.  He has been writing to them.  They are men\n",
       "capable of doing unpleasant things--the Abbe certainly is.  It is fair to\n",
       "warn the tailor.  Shall I leave it to you?  Do not frighten him.  But\n",
       "there is no doubt he should be warned--fair play, fair play!  I hear\n",
       "nothing but good of him from those whose opinions I value.  But, you see,\n",
       "every man's history in this parish and in every parish of the province is\n",
       "known.  This man, for us, has no history.  The Cure even admits there are\n",
       "some grounds for calling him an infidel, but, as you know, he would keep\n",
       "the man here, not drive him out from among us.  I have not told the Cure\n",
       "about the Abbe yet.  I wished first to talk with you.  The Abbe may come\n",
       "at any moment.  I have been away, and only find his letters to-day.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You wish me to tell Monsieur?\" interrupted Rosalie, unable to hold\n",
       "silence any longer.  More than once during the Seigneur's disclosure she\n",
       "had felt that she must cry out and fiercely repel the base insinuations\n",
       "against the man she loved.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You would do it with discretion.  You are friendly with him, are you\n",
       "not?--you talk with him now and then?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She inclined her head.  \"Very well, Monsieur.  I will go to Vadrome\n",
       "Mountain to-morrow,\" she said quietly.  Anger, apprehension, indignation,\n",
       "possessed her, but she held herself firmly.  The Seigneur was doing a\n",
       "friendly thing; and, in any case, she could have no quarrel with him.\n",
       "There was danger to the man she loved, however, and every faculty was\n",
       "alive.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That's right.  He shall have his chance to evade the Abbe if he wishes,\"\n",
       "answered M. Rossignol.\n",
       "\n",
       "There was silence for a moment, in which she was scarcely conscious of\n",
       "his presence; then he leaned over the counter towards her, and spoke in a\n",
       "low voice.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What I said the other day I meant.  I do not change my mind--I am too\n",
       "old for that.  Yet I'm young enough to know that you may change yours.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I cannot change, Monsieur,\" she said tremblingly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But you will change.  I knew your mother well, I know how anxious she\n",
       "was for your future.  I told her once that I should keep an eye on you\n",
       "always.  Her father was my father's good friend.  I knew you when you\n",
       "were in the cradle--a little brown-haired babe.  I watched you till you\n",
       "went to the convent.  I saw you come back to take up the duties which\n",
       "your mother laid down, alas!--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Monsieur--!\" she said choking, and with a troubled little gesture.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You must let me speak, Rosalie.  We got your father this post-office.\n",
       "It is a poor living, but it keeps a roof over your head.  You have never\n",
       "failed us you have always fulfilled our hopes.  But the best years of\n",
       "your life are going, and your education and your nature have not their\n",
       "chance.  Oh, I've not watched you all these years for nothing.  I never\n",
       "meant to ask you to marry me.  It came to me, though, all at once, and\n",
       "I know that it has been in my mind all these years--far back in my mind.\n",
       "I don't ask you for my own sake alone.  Your father may grow very ill--\n",

       "Write a paragraph in a formal, literary style with a serious and reflective tone. The paragraph should focus on a character who is deeply concerned about a significant loss and feels troubled by a threat made by others. Include interactions with a small group of trusted individuals, one of whom is a postmaster who occasionally meets the character in the evening. Describe how the postmaster sometimes assists the character by pushing their wheelchair, engaging in casual conversation about village matters. Use complex sentences with a mix of longer and shorter structures to create a rhythmic flow. Employ elevated vocabulary and subtle descriptive language to evoke a sense of intimacy and quiet contemplation. Ensure the paragraph conveys a sense of community and the character’s reliance on a few close confidants. Aim for a length of 4-6 sentences, maintaining a balance between narrative detail and emotional depth. Avoid direct quotes or overly specific phrases, allowing for creative interpretation while staying true to the original’s essence."

       "trying to comfort her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Rhodopis listened patiently, and smiled the while; at times her smile was\n",

The scene should involve one character noticing the other’s distress and offering to stay by their side to provide comfort. The dialogue should reflect a gentle, caring approach, encouraging the distressed character to share their sorrow as a means of easing their pain. Use a literary style with moderately complex sentences and a vocabulary that conveys warmth and understanding. Include phrases that emphasize the therapeutic value of expressing grief and the potential for such openness to restore inner peace. Maintain a sense of intimacy and sincerity throughout, ensuring the interaction feels heartfelt and genuine.

Begin by introducing a character who discovers that their once-dear friend is engaging in an activity in a location the first character considers their own domain. Use direct dialogue to express the character's outrage, ensuring the language is sharp and accusatory. The paragraph should include a brief description of the setting to ground the scene, but focus primarily on the emotional exchange. Use precise, elevated vocabulary to reflect the characters' sophistication, and structure the sentences to balance narrative flow with dramatic emphasis. Keep the paragraph concise, with a mix of shorter and medium-length sentences to maintain rhythm and intensity. Avoid overly complex phrasing, but ensure the language feels polished and intentional.

       "In the year 1574 A. D.  spring made its joyous entry into the Netherlands\n",
       "at an unusually early date.\n",
       "\n",
       "The sky was blue, gnats sported in the sunshine, white butterflies\n",
       "alighted on the newly-opened yellow flowers, and beside one of the\n",
       "numerous ditches intersecting the wide plain stood a stork, snapping at a\n",
       "fine frog; the poor fellow soon writhed in its enemy's red beak.  One\n",
       "gulp--the merry jumper vanished, and its murderer, flapping its wings,\n",
       "soared high into the air.  On flew the bird over gardens filled with\n",
       "blossoming fruit-trees, trimly laid-out flower-beds, and gaily-painted\n",
       "arbors, across the frowning circlet of walls and towers that girdled the\n",
       "city, over narrow houses with high, pointed gables, and neat streets\n",
       "bordered with elm, poplar, linden and willow-trees, decked with the first\n",
       "green leaves of spring.  At last it alighted on a lofty gable-roof, on\n",
       "whose ridge was its firmly-fastened nest.  After generously giving up its\n",
       "prey to the little wife brooding over the eggs, it stood on one leg and\n",
       "gazed thoughtfully down upon the city, whose shining red tiles gleamed\n",
       "spick and span from the green velvet carpet of the meadows.  The bird had\n",
       "known beautiful Leyden, the gem of Holland, for many a year, and was\n",
       "familiar with all the branches of the Rhine that divided the stately city\n",
       "into numerous islands, and over which arched as many stone bridges as\n",
       "there are days in five months of the year; but surely many changes had\n",
       "occurred here since the stork's last departure for the south.\n",
       "\n",
       "Where were the citizens' gay summer-houses and orchards, where the wooden\n",
       "frames on which the weavers used to stretch their dark and colored\n",
       "cloths?\n",
       "\n",
       "Whatever plant or work of human hands had risen, outside the city walls\n",
       "and towers to the height of a man's breast, thus interrupting the\n",
       "uniformity of the plain, had vanished from the earth, and beyond, on the\n",
       "bird's best hunting-grounds, brownish spots sown with black circles\n",
       "appeared among the green of the meadows.\n",
       "\n",
       "Late in October of the preceding year, just after the storks left the\n",
       "country, a Spanish army had encamped here, and a few hours before the\n",
       "return of the winged wanderers in the first opening days of spring, the\n",
       "besiegers retired without having accomplished their purpose.\n",
       "\n",
       "Barren spots amid the luxuriant growth of vegetation marked the places\n",
       "where they had pitched their tents, the black cinders of the burnt coals\n",
       "their camp-fires.\n",
       "\n",
       "The sorely-threatened inhabitants of the rescued city, with thankful\n",
       "hearts, uttered sighs of relief.  The industrious, volatile populace had\n",
       "speedily forgotten the sufferings endured, for early spring is so\n",
       "beautiful, and never does a rescued life seem so delicious as when we are\n",
       "surrounded by the joys of spring.\n",
       "\n",
       "A new and happier time appeared to have dawned, not only for Nature but\n",
       "for human beings.  The troops quartered in the besieged city, which had\n",
       "the day before committed many an annoyance, had been dismissed with song\n",
       "and music.  The carpenter's axe flashed in the spring sunlight before the\n",
       "red walls, towers and gates, and cut sharply into the beams from which\n",
       "new scaffolds and frames were to be erected; noble cattle grazed\n",
       "peacefully undisturbed around the city, whose desolated gardens were\n",
       "being dug, sowed and planted afresh.  In the streets and houses a\n",
       "thousand hands, which but a short time before had guided spears and\n",
       "arquebuses on the walls and towers, were busy at useful work, and old\n",
       "people sat quietly before their doors to let the warm spring sun shine on\n",
       "their backs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Few discontented faces were to be seen in Leyden on this eighteenth of\n",
       "April.  True, there was no lack of impatient ones, and whoever wanted\n",
       "to seek them need only go to the principal school, where noon was\n",
       "approaching and many boys gazed far more eagerly through the open\n",
       "windows of the school-room, than at the teacher's lips.\n",
       "\n",
       "But in that part of the spacious hall where the older lads received\n",
       "instruction, no restlessness prevailed.  True, the spring sun shone on\n",
       "their books and exercises too, the spring called them into the open air,\n",
       "but even more powerful than its alluring voice seemed the influence\n",
       "exerted on their young minds by what they were now hearing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Forty sparkling eyes were turned towards the bearded man, who addressed\n",
       "them in his deep voice.  Even wild Jan Mulder had dropped the knife with\n",
       "which he had begun to cut on his desk a well-executed figure of a ham,\n",
       "and was listening attentively.\n",
       "\n",
       "The noon bell now rang from the neighboring church, and soon after was\n",
       "heard from the tower of the town-hall, the little boys noisily left the\n",
       "room, but--strange-=the patience of the older ones still held out; they\n",
       "were surely hearing things that did not exactly belong to their lessons.\n",
       "\n",
       "The man who stood before them was no teacher in the school, but the\n",
       "city clerk, Van Hout, who, to-day filled the place of his sick friend,\n",
       "Verstroot, master of arts and preacher.  During the ringing of the bells\n",
       "he had closed the book, and now said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"'Suspendo lectionem.'  Jan Mulder, how would you translate my\n",
       "'suspendere'?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Hang,\" replied the boy.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Hang!\"  laughed Van Hout.  \"You might be hung from a hook perhaps, but\n",
       "where should we hang a lesson?  Adrian Van der Werff.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The lad called rose quickly, saying:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"'Suspendere lectionen' means to break off the lesson.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very well; and if we wanted to hang up Jan Mulder, what should we say?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Patibulare--ad patibulum!\"  cried the scholars.  Van Hout, who had just\n",
       "been smiling, grew very grave.  Drawing a long breath, he said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Patibulo is a bad Latin word, and your fathers, who formerly sat here,\n",
       "understood its meaning far less thoroughly than you.  Now, every child in\n",
       "the Netherlands knows it, Alva has impressed it on our minds.  More than\n",
       "eighteen thousand worthy citizens have come to the gallows through his\n",
       "'ad patibulum.'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "With these words he pulled his short black doublet through his girdle,\n",
       "advanced nearer the first desk, and bending his muscular body forward,\n",
       "said with constantly increasing emotion:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"'This shall be enough for to-day, boys.  It will do no great harm, if\n",
       "you afterwards forget the names earned here.  But always remember one\n",
       "thing: your country first of all.  Leonidas and his three hundred\n",
       "Spartans did not die in vain, so long as there are men ready to follow\n",
       "their example.  Your turn will come too.  It is not my business to boast,\n",
       "but truth is truth.  We Hollanders have furnished fifty times three\n",
       "hundred men for the freedom of our native soil.  In such stormy times\n",
       "there are steadfast men; even boys have shown themselves great.  Ulrich\n",
       "yonder, at your head, can bear his nickname of Lowing with honor.\n",
       "'Hither Persians--hither Greeks!' was said in ancient times, but we cry:\n",
       "'Hither Netherlands, hither Spain!'  And indeed, the proud Darius never\n",
       "ravaged Greece as King Philip has devastated Holland.  Ay, my lads,\n",
       "many flowers bloom in the breasts of men.  Among them is hatred of the\n",
       "poisonous hemlock.  Spain has sowed it in our gardens.  I feel it growing\n",
       "within me, and you too feel and ought to feel it.  But don't\n",
       "misunderstand me!  'Hither Spain--hither Netherlands!' is the cry, and\n",
       "not: 'Hither Catholics and hither Protestants.'  Every faith may be right\n",
       "in the Lord's eyes, if only the man strives earnestly to walk in Christ's\n",
       "ways.  At the throne of Heaven, it will not be asked:  Are you Papist,\n",
       "Calvinist, or Lutheran?  but: What were your intentions and acts?\n",
       "Respect every man's belief; but despise him who makes common cause with\n",
       "the tyrant against the liberty of our native land.  Now pray silently,\n",
       "then you may go home.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The scholars rose; Van Hout wiped the perspiration from his high\n",
       "forehead, and while the boys were collecting books, pencils, and pens,\n",
       "said slowly, as if apologizing to himself for the words already uttered:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What I have told you perhaps does not belong to the school-room; but,\n",
       "my lads, this battle is still far from being ended, and though you must\n",
       "occupy the school-benches for a while, you are the future soldiers.\n",
       "Lowing, remain behind, I have something to say to you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He slowly turned his back to the boys, who rushed out of doors.  In a\n",
       "corner of the yard of St. Peter's church, which was behind the building\n",
       "and entered by few of the passers-by, they stood still, and from amid the\n",
       "wild confusion of exclamations arose a sort of consultation, to which the\n",
       "organ-notes echoing from the church formed a strange accompaniment.\n",
       "\n",
       "They were trying to decide upon the game to be played in the afternoon.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was a matter of course, after what Van Hout had said, that there\n",
       "should be a battle; it had not even been proposed by anybody, but the\n",
       "discussion that now arose proceeded from the supposition.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was soon decided that patriots and Spaniards, not Greeks and\n",
       "Persians, were to appear in the lists against each other; but when the\n",
       "burgomaster's son, Adrian Van der Werff, a lad of fourteen, proposed to\n",
       "form the two parties, and in the imperious way peculiar to him attempted\n",
       "to make Paul Van Swieten and Claus Dirkson Spaniards, he encountered\n",
       "violent opposition, and the troublesome circumstance was discovered that\n",
       "no one was willing to represent a foreign soldier.\n",
       "\n",
       "Each boy wanted to make somebody else a Castilian, and fight himself\n",
       "under the banner of the Netherlands.  But friends and foes are necessary\n",
       "for a war, and Holland's heroic courage required Spaniards to prove it.\n",
       "The youngsters grew excited, the cheeks of the disputants began to flush,\n",
       "here and there clenched fists were raised, and everything indicated that\n",
       "a horrible civil war would precede the battle to be given the foes of the\n",
       "country.\n",
       "\n",
       "In truth, these lively boys were ill-suited to play the part of King\n",
       "Philip's gloomy, stiff-necked soldiers.  Amid the many fair heads, few\n",
       "lads were seen with brown locks, and only one with black hair and dark\n",
       "eyes.  This was Adam Baersdorp, whose father, like Van der Werff's, was\n",
       "one of the leaders of the citizens.  When he too refused to act a\n",
       "Spaniard, one of the boys exclaimed:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You won't?  Yet my father says your father is half a Glipper,--[The name\n",
       "given in Holland to those who sympathized with Spain]--and a whole Papist\n",
       "to boot.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "At these words young Baersdorp threw his books on the ground, and was\n",
       "rushing with upraised fist upon his enemy--but Adrian Van der Werff\n",
       "hastily interposed, crying:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"For shame, Cornelius.--I'll stop the mouth of anybody who utters such an\n",
       "insult again.  Catholics are Christians, as well as we.  You heard it\n",
       "from Van Hout, and my father says so too.  Will you be a Spaniard, Adam,\n",
       "yes or no?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No!\" cried the latter firmly.  \"And if anybody else--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You can quarrel afterward,\" said Adrian Van der Werff, interrupting his\n",
       "excited companions, then good-naturedly picking up the books Baersdorp\n",
       "had flung down, and handing them to him, continued resolutely, \"I'll be a\n",
       "Spaniard to-day.  Who else?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I, I, I too, for aught I care,\" shouted several of the scholars, and the\n",
       "forming of the two parties would have been carried on in the best order\n",
       "to the end, if the boys' attention had not been diverted by a fresh\n",
       "incident.\n",
       "\n",
       "A young gentleman, followed by a black servant, came up the street\n",
       "directly towards them.  He too was a Netherlander, but had little in\n",
       "common with the school-boys except his age, a red and white complexion,\n",
       "fair hair, and clear blue eyes, eyes that looked arrogantly out upon the\n",
       "world.  Every step showed that he considered himself an important\n",
       "personage, and the gaily-costumed negro, who carried a few recently\n",
       "purchased articles behind him, imitated this bearing in a most comical\n",
       "way.  The negro's head was held still farther back than the young\n",
       "noble's, whose stiff Spanish ruff prevented him from moving his handsome\n",
       "head as freely as other mortals.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That ape, Wibisma,\" said one of the school-boys, pointing to the\n",
       "approaching nobleman.\n",
       "\n",
       "All eyes turned towards him, scornfully scanning his little velvet hat\n",
       "decked with a long plume, the quilted red satin garment padded in the\n",
       "breast and sleeves, the huge puffs of his short brown breeches, and the\n",
       "brilliant scarlet silk stockings that closely fitted his well-formed\n",
       "limbs.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The ape,\" repeated Paul Van Swieten.  \"He wants to be a cardinal, that's\n",
       "why he wears so much red.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And looks as Spanish as if he came straight from Madrid,\" cried another\n",
       "lad, while a third added:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The Wibismas certainly were not to be found here, so long as bread was\n",
       "short with us.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The Wibismas are all Glippers.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And he struts about on week-days, dressed in velvet and silk,\" said\n",
       "Adrian.  \"Just look at the black boy the red-legged stork has brought\n",
       "with him to Leyden.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The scholars burst into a loud laugh, and as soon as the youth had\n",
       "reached them, Paul Van Swieten snarled in a nasal tone:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How did deserting suit you?  How are affairs in Spain, master Glipper?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The young noble raised his head still higher, the negro did the same, and\n",
       "both walked quietly on, even when Adrian shouted in his ear:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Little Glipper, tell me, for how many pieces of silver did Judas sell\n",
       "the Saviour?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Young Matanesse Van Wibisma made an indignant gesture, but controlled\n",
       "himself until Jan Mulder stepped in front of him, holding his little\n",
       "cloth cap, into which he had thrust a hen's feather, under his chin like\n",
       "a beggar, and saying humbly:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Give me a little shrove-money for our tom-cat, Sir Grandee; he stole a\n",
       "leg of veal from the butcher yesterday.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Out of my way!\"  said the youth in a haughty, resolute tone, trying to\n",
       "push Mulder aside with the back of his hand.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Hands off, Glipper!\"  cried the school-boys, raising their clenched\n",
       "hands threateningly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then let me alone,\" replied Wibisma, \"I want no quarrel, least of all\n",
       "with you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why not with us?\"  asked Adrian Van der Werff, irritated by the\n",
       "supercilious, arrogant tone of the last words.\n",
       "\n",
       "The youth shrugged his shoulders, but Adrian cried: \"Because you like\n",
       "your Spanish costume better than our doublets of Leyden cloth.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Here he paused, for Jan Mulder stole behind Wibisma, struck his hat down\n",
       "on his head with a book, and while Nicolas Van Wibisma was trying to free\n",
       "his eyes from the covering that shaded them, exclaimed:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There, Sir Grandee, now the little hat sits firm!  You can keep it on,\n",
       "even before the king.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The negro could not go to his master's assistance, for his arms were\n",
       "filled with parcels, but the young noble did not call him, knowing how\n",
       "cowardly his black servant was, and feeling strong enough to help\n",
       "himself.\n",
       "\n",
       "A costly clasp, which he had just received as a gift on his seventeenth\n",
       "birthday, confined the plume in his hat; but without a thought he flung\n",
       "it aside, stretched out his arms as if for a wrestling-match, and with\n",
       "florid cheeks, asked in a loud, resolute tone: \"Who did that?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Jan Mulder had hastily retreated among his companions, and instead of\n",
       "coming forward and giving his name, called:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Look for the hat-fuller, Glipper!  We'll play blindman's buff.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The youth, frantic with rage, repeated his question.  When, instead of\n",
       "any other answer, the boys entered into Jan Mulder's jest,  shouting\n",
       "gaily: \"Yes,  play blind-man's buff!  Look for the hat-fuller.  Come,\n",
       "little Glipper, begin.\"  Nicolas could contain himself no longer, but\n",
       "shouted furiously to the laughing throng:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Cowardly rabble!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Scarcely had the words been uttered, when Paul Van Swieten raised his\n",
       "grammar, bound in hog-skin, and hurled it at Wibisma's breast.\n",
       "\n",
       "Other books followed, amid loud outcries, striking him on the legs and\n",
       "shoulders.  Bewildered, he shielded his face with his hands and retreated\n",
       "to the church-yard wall, where he stood still and prepared to rush upon\n",
       "his foes.\n",
       "\n",
       "The stiff, fashionable high Spanish ruff no longer confined his handsome\n",
       "head with its floating golden locks.  Freely and boldly he looked his\n",
       "enemies in the face, stretched the young limbs hardened by many a\n",
       "knightly exercise, and with a true Netherland oath sprang upon Adrian Van\n",
       "der Werff, who stood nearest.\n",
       "\n",
       "After a short struggle, the burgomaster's son, inferior in strength and\n",
       "age to his opponent, lay extended on the ground; but the other lads, who\n",
       "had not ceased shouting, \"Glipper, Glipper,\" seized the young noble, who\n",
       "was kneeling on his vanquished foe.\n",
       "\n",
       "Nicolas struggled bravely, but his enemies' superior power was too great.\n",
       "\n",
       "Frantic with fury, wild with rage and shame, he snatched the dagger from\n",
       "his belt.\n",
       "\n",
       "The boys now raised a frightful yell, and two of them rushed upon Nicolas\n",
       "to wrest the weapon from him.  This was quickly accomplished; the dagger\n",
       "flew on the pavement, but Van Swieten sprang back with a low cry, for the\n",
       "sharp blade had struck his arm, and the bright blood streamed on the\n",
       "ground.\n",
       "\n",
       "For several minutes the shouts of the lads and the piteous cries of the\n",
       "black page drowned the beautiful melody of the organ, pouring from the\n",
       "windows of the church.  Suddenly the music ceased; instead of the\n",

       "young friend, and there is your hat.  Pick them up, and remember that\n",
       "such a weapon is no toy.  Many a man has spoiled his whole life, by\n",

       "Young Adrian hurried down the Werffsteg, which had given his family its\n",
       "name.  He heeded neither the lindens on both sides, amid whose tops the\n",
       "first tiny green leaves were forcing their way out of the pointed buds,\n",
       "nor the birds that flew hither and thither among the hospitable boughs of\n",
       "the stately trees, building their nests and twittering to each other, for\n",
       "he had no thought in his mind except to reach home as quickly as\n",
       "possible.\n",
       "\n",
       "Beyond the bridge spanning the Achtergracht, he paused irresolutely\n",
       "before a large building.\n",
       "\n",
       "The knocker hung on the central door, but he did not venture to lift it\n",
       "and let it fall on the shining plate beneath, for he could expect no\n",
       "pleasant reception from his family.\n",
       "\n",
       "His doublet had fared ill during his struggle with his stronger enemy.\n",
       "The torn neck-ruffles had been removed from their proper place and thrust\n",
       "into his pocket, and the new violet stocking on his right leg, luckless\n",
       "thing, had been so frayed by rubbing on the pavement, that a large\n",
       "yawning rent showed far more of Adrian's white knee than was agreeable to\n",
       "him.\n",
       "\n",
       "The peacock feather in his little velvet cap could easily be replaced,\n",
       "but the doublet was torn, not ripped, and the stocking scarcely capable\n",
       "of being mended.  The boy was sincerely sorry, for his father had bade\n",
       "him take good care of the stuff to save money; during these times there\n",
       "were hard shifts in the big house, which with its three doors, triple\n",
       "gables adorned with beautifully-arched volutes, and six windows in the\n",
       "upper and lower stories, fronted the Werffsteg in a very proud, stately\n",
       "guise.\n",
       "\n",
       "The burgomaster's office did not bring in a large income, and Adrian's\n",
       "grandfather's trade of preparing chamois leather, as well as the business\n",
       "in skins, was falling off; his father had other matters in his head,\n",
       "matters that claimed not only his intellect, strength and time, but also\n",
       "every superfluous farthing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Adrian had nothing pleasant to expect at home--certainly not from his\n",
       "father, far less from his aunt Barbara.  Yet the boy dreaded the anger of\n",
       "these two far less, than a single disapproving glance from the eyes of\n",
       "the young wife, whom he had called \"mother\" scarcely a twelve month, and\n",
       "who was only six years his senior.\n",
       "\n",
       "She never said an unkind word to him, but his defiance and wildness\n",
       "melted before her beauty, her quiet, aristocratic manner.  He scarcely\n",
       "knew himself whether he loved her or not, but she appeared like the good\n",
       "fairy of whom the fairy tales spoke, and it often seemed as if she were\n",
       "far too delicate, dainty and charming for her simple, unpretending home.\n",
       "To see her smile rendered the boy happy, and when she looked sad--a thing\n",
       "that often happened-it made his heart ache.  Merciful Heavens!  She\n",
       "certainly could not receive him kindly when she saw his doublet, the\n",
       "ruffles thrust into his pocket, and his unlucky stockings.\n",
       "\n",
       "And then!\n",
       "\n",
       "There were the bells ringing again!\n",
       "\n",
       "The dinner hour had long since passed, and his father waited for no one.\n",

       "compassion on him in the kitchen.\n",
       "\n",
       "But what was the use of pondering and hesitating?  Adrian summoned up all\n",
       "his courage, clenched his teeth, clasped his right hand still closer\n",
       "around the torn ruffles in his pocket, and struck the knocker loudly on\n",
       "the steel plate beneath.\n",
       "\n",
       "Trautchen, the old maid-servant, opened the door, and in the spacious,\n",
       "dusky entrance-hall, where the bales of leather were packed closely\n",
       "together, did not notice the dilapidation of his outer man.\n",
       "\n",
       "He hurried swiftly up the stairs.\n",
       "\n",
       "The dining-room door was open, and--marvellous--the table was still\n",

       "usual.\n",
       "\n",
       "Adrian rushed with long leaps to his little attic room, dressed himself\n",
       "neatly, and entered the presence of his family before the master of the\n",

       "\n",
       "The doublet and stocking could be confided to the hands of Aunt Barbara\n",
       "or Trautchen, at some opportune hour.\n",
       "\n",
       "Adrian sturdily attacked the smoking dishes; but his heart soon grew\n",
       "heavy, for his father did not utter a word, and gazed into vacancy as\n",
       "gravely and anxiously as at the time when misery entered the beleagured\n",
       "city.\n",
       "\n",
       "The boy's young step-mother sat opposite her husband, and often glanced\n",
       "at Peter Van der Werff's grave face to win a loving glance from him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Whenever she did so in vain, she pushed her soft, golden hair back from\n",
       "her forehead, raised her beautiful head higher, or bit her lips and gazed\n",
       "silently into her plate.\n",
       "\n",
       "In reply to Aunt Barbara's questions: \"What happened at the council?  Has\n",
       "the money for the new bell been collected?  Will Jacob Van Sloten rent\n",
       "you the meadow?\"  he made curt, evasive replies.\n",
       "\n",
       "The steadfast man, who sat so silently with frowning brow among his\n",
       "family, sometimes attacking the viands on his plate, then leaving them\n",
       "untouched, did not look like one who yields to idle whims.\n",
       "\n",
       "All present, even the men and maid-servants, were still devoting\n",
       "themselves to the food, when the master of the house rose, and pressing\n",
       "both hands over the back of his head, which was very prominently\n",
       "developed, exclaimed groaning:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I can hold out no longer.  Do you give thanks, Maria.  Go to the town-\n",
       "hall, Janche, and ask if no messenger has yet arrived.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The man-servant wiped his mouth and instantly obeyed.  He was a tall,\n",
       "broad-shouldered Frieselander, but only reached to his master's forehead.\n",
       "\n",
       "Peter Van der Werff, without any form of salutation, turned his back on\n",
       "his family, opened the door leading into his study, and after crossing\n",
       "the threshold, closed it with a bang, approached the big oak writing-\n",
       "desk, on which papers and letters lay piled in heaps, secured by rough\n",
       "leaden weights, and began to rummage among the newly-arrived documents.\n",
       "For fifteen minutes he vainly strove to fix the necessary attention upon\n",
       "his task, then grasped his study-chair to rest his folded arms on the\n",
       "high, perforated back, adorned with simple carving, and gazed\n",
       "thoughtfully at the wooden wainscoting of the ceiling.  After a few\n",
       "minutes he pushed the chair aside with his foot, raised his hand to his\n",
       "mouth, separated his moustache from his thick brown beard, and went to\n",
       "the window.  The small, round, leaden-cased panes, however brightly they\n",
       "might be polished, permitted only a narrow portion of the street to be\n",
       "seen, but the burgomaster seemed to have found the object for which he\n",
       "had been looking.  Hastily opening the window, he called to his servant,\n",
       "who was hurriedly approaching the house:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is he in, Janche?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The Frieselander shook his head, the window again closed, and a few\n",
       "minutes after the burgomaster seized his hat, which hung, between some\n",
       "cavalry pistols and a plain, substantial sword, on the only wall of his\n",
       "room not perfectly bare.\n",
       "\n",
       "The torturing anxiety that filled his mind, would no longer allow him to\n",
       "remain in the house.\n",
       "\n",
       "He would have his horse saddled, and ride to meet the expected messenger.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ere leaving the room, he paused a moment lost in thought, then approached\n",
       "the writing-table to sign some papers intended for the town-hall; for his\n",
       "return might be delayed till night.\n",
       "\n",
       "Still standing, he looked over the two sheets he had spread out before\n",
       "him, and seized the pen.  Just at that moment the door of the room gently\n",
       "opened, and the fresh sand strewn over the white boards creaked under\n",
       "a light foot.  He doubtless heard it, but did not allow himself to be\n",
       "interrupted.\n",
       "\n",
       "His wife was now standing close behind him.  Four and twenty years his\n",
       "junior, she seemed like a timid girl, as she raised her arm, yet did not\n",
       "venture to divert her husband's attention from his business.\n",
       "\n",
       "She waited quietly till he had signed the first paper, then turned her\n",
       "pretty head aside, and blushing faintly, exclaimed with downcast eyes:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is I, Peter!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very well, my child,\" he answered curtly, raising the second paper\n",
       "nearer his eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Peter!\"  she exclaimed a second time, still more eagerly, but with\n",
       "timidity.  \"I have something to tell you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Van der Werff turned his head, cast a hasty, affectionate glance at her,\n",
       "and said:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Now, child?  You see I am busy, and there is my hat.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But Peter!\"  she replied, a flash of something like indignation\n",
       "sparkling in her eyes, as she continued in a voice pervaded with a\n",
       "slightly perceptible tone of complaint: \"We haven't said anything to each\n",
       "other to-day.  My heart is so full, and what I would fain say to you is,\n",
       "must surely--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When I come home Maria, not now,\" he interrupted, his deep voice\n",
       "sounding half impatient, half beseeching.  \"First the city and the\n",
       "country--then love-making.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "At these words, Maria raised her head proudly, and answered with\n",
       "quivering lips:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is what you have said ever since the first day of our marriage.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And unhappily--unhappily--I must continue to say so until we reach the\n",
       "goal,\" he answered firmly.  The blood mounted into the young wife's\n",
       "delicate cheeks, and with quickened breathing, she answered in a hasty,\n",
       "resolute tone:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, indeed, I have known these words ever since your courtship, and as\n",
       "I am my father's daughter never opposed them, but now they are no longer\n",
       "suited to us, and should be: 'Everything for the country, and nothing at\n",
       "all for the wife.'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Van der Werff laid down his pen and turned full towards her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Maria's slender figure seemed to have grown taller, and the blue eyes,\n",
       "swimming in tears, flashed proudly.  This life-companion seemed to have\n",
       "been created by God especially for him.  His heart opened to her, and\n",
       "frankly stretching out both hands, he said tenderly:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You know how matters are!  This heart is changeless, and other days will\n",
       "come.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When?\"  asked Maria, in a tone as mournful as if she believed in no\n",
       "happier future.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Soon,\" replied her husband firmly.  \"Soon, if only each one gives\n",
       "willingly what our native land demands.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "At these words the young wife loosed her hands from her husband's, for\n",
       "the door had opened and Barbara called to her brother from the threshold.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Herr Matanesse Van Wibisma, the Glipper, is in the entry and wants to\n",
       "speak to you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Show him up,\" said the burgomaster reluctantly.  When again alone with\n",
       "his wife, he asked hastily \"Will you be indulgent and help me?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She nodded assent, trying to smile.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Speak,\" said the burgomaster, and the nobleman now briefly, and with\n",

       "\"I'll inform the rector of the annoying incident,\" replied Van der Werff,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Both sides must be fairly heard,\" replied Van der Werff calmly.  \"That\n",

       "\n",
       "\"By no means,\" answered the knight resolutely.  \"If I had thought the\n",
       "matter belonged to the rector's department, I should have sought him and\n",
       "not you, Herr Peter.  My son has his own tutor, and was not attacked in\n",
       "your school, which in any case he has outgrown, for he is seventeen, but\n",
       "in the public street, whose security it is the burgomaster's duty to\n",
       "guard.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very well then, make your complaint, take the youth before the judges,\n",
       "summon witnesses and let the law follow its course.  But, sir,\" continued\n",
       "Van der Werff, softening the impatience in his voice, \"were you not young\n",

       "What pleasure will it afford you, if we lock up a few thoughtless lads\n",
       "for two days this sunny weather?  The scamps will find something amusing\n",
       "to do indoors, as well as out, and only the parents will be punished.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The last words were uttered so cordially and pleasantly, that they could\n",
       "not fail to have their effect upon the baron.  He was a handsome man,\n",
       "whose refined, agreeable features, of the true Netherland type, expressed\n",
       "anything rather than severity.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If you speak to me in this tone, we shall come to an agreement more\n",
       "easily,\" he answered, smiling.  \"I will only say this.  Had the brawl\n",

       "word on the matter--but that children already venture to assail with\n",
       "jeers and violence those who hold different opinions, ought not to be\n",
       "permitted to pass without reproof.  The boys shouted after my son the\n",

       "straighter paths than Orange--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I cannot test here whether your paths are crooked or straight,\" retorted\n",

       "nobleman sharply in the eye, \"I speak rather of the tyrant, whose bloody\n",
       "council declared all who bore the Netherland name, and you among us,\n",
       "criminals worthy of death; who, through his destroying devil, Alva,\n",
       "burned, beheaded, and hung thousands of honest men, robbed and exiled\n",
       "from the country thousands of others, I speak of the profligate--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Enough!\"  cried the knight, clenching the hilt of his sword.  \"Who gives\n",
       "you the right--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who gives me the right to speak so bitterly, you would ask?\"\n",
       "interrupted Peter Van der Werff, meeting the nobleman's eyes with a\n",
       "gloomy glance.  \"Who gives me this right?  I need not conceal it.  It was\n",
       "bestowed by the silent lips of my valiant father, beheaded for the sake\n",
       "of his faith, by the arbitrary decree, that without form of law, banished\n",
       "my brother and myself from the country--by the Spaniards' broken vows,\n",
       "the torn charters of this land, the suffering of the poor, ill-treated,\n",
       "worthy people that will perish if we do not save them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You will not save them,\" replied Wibisma in a calmer tone.  \"You will\n",

       "\n",
       "\"We are pilots.  Perhaps we shall bring deliverance, perhaps we shall go\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Baron, you have crossed this threshold as complainant to the\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Quite true, but I came with kind intentions, as monitor to the guiding\n",

       "\n",
       "Van der Werff pressed his fingers firmly on the wood of the writing-\n",
       "table.  The fresh color of his cheeks and lips had yielded to a livid\n",
       "pallor, and his mouth quivered painfully as he asked in a low, hollow\n",
       "tone, \"Louis dead, really dead?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Dead,\" replied the baron firmly, though sorrowfully.  \"We were enemies,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Dead, William's favorite dead!\"  murmured the burgomaster as if in a\n",

       "\n",
       "\"No, only this one more word, this one word.  I know you upbraid us as\n",
       "'Glippers,' deserters, but as truly as I hope for God's mercy, you\n",
       "misjudge us.  No, Herr Peter, no, I am no traitor!  I love this country\n",
       "and this brave, industrious people with the same love as yourself, for\n",
       "its blood flows in my veins also.  I signed the compromise.  Here I\n",
       "stand, sir.  Look at me.  Do I look like a Judas?  Do I look like a\n",
       "Spaniard?  Can you blame me for faithfully keeping the oath I gave the\n",
       "king?  When did we of the Netherlands ever trifle with vows?  You, the\n",
       "friend of Orange, have just declared that you did not grudge any man the\n",
       "faith to which he clung, and I will not doubt it.  Well, I hold firmly to\n",
       "the old church, I am a Catholic and shall remain one.  But in this hour I\n",
       "frankly confess, that I hate the inquisition and Alva's bloody deeds as\n",
       "much as you do.  They have as little connection with our religion as\n",
       "iconoclasm had with yours  Like you, I love the freedom of our home.\n",
       "To win it back is my endeavor, as well as yours.  But how can a little\n",

       "stronger armies will follow each defeated one.  We shall accomplish\n",
       "nothing by force, but may do much by wise concession and prudent deeds.\n",
       "Philip's coffers are empty; he needs his armies too in other countries.\n",
       "Well then, let us profit by his difficulties, and force him to ratify\n",
       "some lost liberty for every revolted city that returns to him.  Let us\n",
       "buy from his hands, with what remains of our old wealth, the rights he\n",

       "ventured it and entered the tiger's den.  What we buy to-day will surely\n",
       "be taken from us tomorrow, for what oath would be sacred to Philip?  I am\n",
       "no statesman, but I know this--if he would restore all our liberties, he\n",

       "\n",
       "Countless citizens had flocked to the stately townhall.  News of Louis of\n",
       "Nassau's defeat had spread quickly through all the eighteen wards of the\n",
       "city, and each wanted to learn farther particulars, express his grief and\n",
       "fears to those who held the same views, and hear what measures the\n",
       "council intended to adopt for the immediate future.\n",
       "\n",
       "Two messengers had only too thoroughly confirmed Baron Matanesse Van\n",
       "Wibisma's communication.  Louis was dead, his brother Henry missing, and\n",
       "his army completely destroyed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jan Van Hout, who had taught the boys that morning, now came to a window,\n",
       "informed the citizens what a severe blow the liberty of the country had\n",
       "received, and in vigorous words exhorted them to support the good cause\n",
       "with body and soul.\n",
       "\n",
       "Loud cheers followed this speech.  Gay caps and plumed hats were tossed\n",
       "in the air, canes and swords were waved, and the women and children, who\n",
       "had crowded among the men, fluttered their handkerchiefs, and with their\n",
       "shriller voices drowned the shouts of the citizens.\n",
       "\n",
       "The members of the valiant city-guard assembled, to charge their captain\n",
       "to give the council the assurance, that the \"Schutterij\" was ready to\n",
       "support William of Orange to the last penny and drop of their blood, and\n",
       "would rather die for the cause of Holland, than live under Spanish\n",
       "tyranny.  Among them was seen many a grave, deeply-troubled face; for\n",
       "these men, who filled its ranks by their own choice, all loved William of\n",
       "Orange: his sorrow hurt them--and their country's distress pierced their\n",
       "hearts.  As soon as the four burgomasters, the eight magistrates of the\n",
       "city, and the members of the common council appeared at the windows,\n",
       "hundreds of voices joined in the Geusenlied,--[Beggars' Song or Hymn.\n",
       "Beggar was the name given to the patriots by those who sympathized with\n",
       "Spain.]--which had long before been struck up by individuals, and when at\n",
       "sunset the volatile populace scattered and, still singing, turned, either\n",
       "singly or by twos or threes, towards the taverns, to strengthen their\n",
       "confidence in better days and dispel many a well-justified anxiety by\n",
       "drink, the market-place of Leyden and its adjoining streets presented no\n",

       "town-hall.\n",
       "\n",
       "The cheers and Beggars' Song had sounded very powerful--but so many\n",
       "hundreds of Dutch throats would doubtless have been capable of shaking\n",
       "the air with far mightier tones.\n",
       "\n",
       "This very remark had been made by the three welldressed citizens, who\n",
       "were walking through the wide street, past the blue stone, and the eldest\n",
       "said to his companions:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"They boast and shout and seem large to themselves now, but we shall see\n",
       "that things will soon be very different.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"May God avert the worst!\"  replied the other, \"but the Spaniards will\n",
       "surely advance again, and I know many in my ward who won't vote for\n",
       "resistance this time.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"They are right, a thousand times right.  Requesens is not Alva, and if\n",

       "\"There would be no blood shed and everything would take the best course.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have more love for Holland than for Spain,\" said the third.  \"But,\n",
       "after Mook-Heath, resistance is a thing of the past.  Orange may be an\n",
       "excellent prince, but the shirt is closer than the coat.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And in fact we risk our lives and fortunes merely for him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My wife said so yesterday.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He'll be the last man to help trade.  Believe me, many think as we do,\n",
       "if it were not so, the Beggars' Song would have sounded louder.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There will always be five fools to three wise men,\" said the older\n",
       "citizen.  \"I took good care not to split my mouth.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And after all, what great thing is there behind this outcry for freedom?\n",
       "Alva burnt the Bible-readers, De la Marck hangs the priests.  My wife\n",
       "likes to go to Mass, but always does so secretly, as if she were\n",
       "committing a crime.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We, too, cling to the good old faith.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Never mind faith,\" said the third.  We are Calvinists, but I take no\n",
       "pleasure in throwing my pennies into Orange's maw, nor can it gratify me\n",
       "to again tear up the poles before the Cow-gate, ere the wind dries the\n",
       "yarn.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Only let us hold together,\" advised the older man.  \"People don't\n",

       "hero.  But I tell you there will be sensible men enough in every ward,\n",
       "every guild, nay, even in the council, and among the burgomasters.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Hush,\" whispered the second citizen, \"there comes Van der Werff with the\n",

       "\n",

       "together, but in low tones.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My uncle is right, Meister Peter,\" said Jan Van der Does, the same tall\n",
       "young noble, who, on the morning of that day, had sent Nicolas Van\n",
       "Wibisma home with a kindly warning.  \"It's no use, you must seek the\n",
       "Prince and consult with him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I suppose I must,\" replied the burgomaster.  \"I'll go to-morrow\n",
       "morning.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not to-morrow,\" replied Van Hout.  \"The Prince rides fast, and if you\n",
       "don't find him in Delft--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do you go first,\" urged the burgomaster, \"you have the record of our\n",
       "session.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I cannot; but to-day you, the Prince's friend, for the first time lack\n",
       "good-will.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are right, Jan,\" exclaimed the burgomaster, \"and you shall know what\n",
       "holds me back.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If it is anything a friend can do for you, here he stands,\" said von\n",
       "Nordwyk.\n",
       "\n",
       "Van der Werff grasped the hand the young nobleman extended, and answered,\n",
       "smiling: \"No, my lord, no.  You know my young wife.  To-day we should\n",
       "have celebrated the first anniversary of our marriage, and amid all these\n",
       "anxieties I disgracefully forgot it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Hard, hard,\" said Van Hout, softly.  Then he drew himself up to his full\n",
       "height, and added resolutely: \"And yet, were I in your place, I would go,\n",
       "in spite of her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Would you go to-day?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To-day, for to-morrow it may be too late.  Who knows how soon egress\n",
       "from the city may be stopped and, before again venturing the utmost, we\n",
       "must know the Prince's opinion.  You possess more of his confidence than\n",
       "any of us.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And God knows how gladly I would bring him a cheering word in these\n",
       "sorrowful hours; but it must not be to-day.  The messenger has ridden off\n",
       "on my bay.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then take my chestnut, he is faster too,\" said Janus Dousa and Van der\n",
       "Werff answered hastily.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Thanks, my lord.  I'll send for him early tomorrow morning.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The blood mounted to Van Hout's head and, thrusting his hand angrily\n",
       "between his girdle and doublet, he exclaimed: \"Send me the chestnut, if\n",
       "the burgomaster will give me leave of absence.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, send him to me,\" replied Peter calmly.  \"What must be, must be; I'll\n",
       "go to-day.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Van Hout's manly features quickly smoothed and, clasping the\n",
       "burgomaster's right hand in both his, he said joyously:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Thanks, Herr Peter.  And no offence; you know my hot temper.  If the\n",
       "time seems long to your young wife, send her to mine.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And mine,\" added Dousa.  \"It's a strange thing about those two little\n",
       "words 'wish' and 'ought.'  The freer and better a man becomes, the more\n",
       "surely the first becomes the slave of the second.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And yet, Herr Peter, I'll wager that your wife will confound the two\n",
       "words to-day, and think you have sorely transgressed against the 'ought.'\n",
       "These are bad times for the 'wish.'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Van der Werff nodded assent, then briefly and firmly explained to his\n",
       "friends what he intended to disclose to the Prince.\n",
       "\n",
       "The three men separated before the burgomaster's house.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Tell the Prince,\" said Van Hout, on parting, \"that we are prepared for\n",
       "the worst, will endure and dare it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "At these words Janus Dousa measured both his companions with his eyes,\n",
       "his lips quivered as they always did when any strong emotion filled his\n",
       "heart, and while his shrewd face beamed with joy and confidence, he\n",
       "exclaimed: \"We three will hold out, we three will stand firm, the tyrant\n",
       "may break our necks, but he shall not bend them.  Life, fortune, all that\n",
       "is dear and precious and useful to man, we will resign for the highest of\n",
       "blessings.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ay,\" said Van der Werff, loudly and earnestly, while Van Hout\n",
       "impetuously repeated: \"Yes, yes, thrice yes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The three men, so united in feeling, grasped each other's hands firmly\n",
       "for a moment.  A silent vow bound them in this hour, and when Herr von\n",
       "Nordwyk and Van Hout turned in opposite directions, the citizens who met\n",

       "few hours.\n",

       "\n",

       "to its full height, paced up and down the room, entirely absorbed in his\n",
       "task.\n",

       "\n",
       "She was a shrewd woman, with much experience of the world, who certainly\n",

       "of the Prince of Orange, no man on earth would be more skilful than Peter\n",
       "in guiding the cause of freedom to a successful end; but she felt that\n",
       "her brother was not treating Maria justly, and being a fair-minded woman,\n",
       "silently took sides against the husband who neglected his wife.\n",
       "\n",
       "Both walked side by side for a time in silence.  At last the widow\n",
       "paused, saying:\n",

       "through life stiff and straight, do my duty cheerfully; my cheeks are\n",
       "rosy, my food has a relish, yet I've been obliged to resign what was\n",

       "Sea.  Any hour may rob me of him, for his life is one of constant peril.\n",
       "What has a widow except her only son?  And I gave him up for our\n",

       "stable-boy held by the bridle a gaily-bedizened, long maned pony.  This\n",
       "was intended for the young negro lad, who stood in the door-way of the\n",

       "of a house.  Spring had as yet lured no leaves from the boughs, but there\n",
       "were many objects to be seen in the bare top of the tree.  A small flag,\n",
       "bearing the colors of the House of Orange, was fastened to one branch,\n",
       "from another hung a large doll, which at a distance strongly resembled a\n",
       "man dressed in black, an old hat dangled from a third, and a fourth\n",
       "supported a piece of white pasteboard, on which might be read in large\n",

       "\n",
       "Ravens had alighted beside the doll swaying to and fro in the wind,\n",
       "probably mistaking it for a man.  They must have been by no means\n",
       "teachable birds, for during the years the Spaniards had ruled in Holland,\n",
       "the places of execution were never empty.  They were screeching as if in\n",
       "anger, but still remained perched on the tree, which they probably\n",
       "mistook for a gibbet.  The rest of the comical ornaments and the thought\n",
       "of the nimble adventurer, who must have climbed up to fasten them, formed\n",
       "a glaring and offensive contrast to the caricature of the gallows.\n",
       "\n",
       "Yet Nicolas laughed loudly, as he perceived the queer objects in the top\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Yes, my lord, and 'pon my soul, it looked very comical yesterday, when\n",
       "the ravens were not to be seen; a fellow couldn't look at it without\n",
       "laughing.  Half Leyden was there, and we went with the crowd.  There was\n",
       "such an uproar on the grass-plot yonder.  Dudeldum--Hubutt, Hubutt--\n",
       "Dudeldum--fiddles squeaking and bag-pipes droning as if they never would\n",
       "stop.  The crazy throng shouted amidst the din; the noise still rings in\n",
       "my ears.  There was no end to the games and dancing.  The lads tossed\n",
       "their brown, blue and red-stockinged legs in the air, just as the fiddle\n",
       "played--the coat-tails flew and, holding a girl clasped in the right arm\n",
       "and a mug of beer high over their heads till the foam spattered, the\n",
       "throng of men whirled round and round.  There was as much screaming and\n",
       "rejoicing as if every butter-cup in the grass had been changed into a\n",
       "gold florin.  But to-day--holy Florian--this is a rain!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It will do the things up there good,\" exclaimed the baron.  \"The tinder\n",

       "shabby liberty hat and motley tatters off the tree.\"\n",

       "themselves will come to the gallows.  Steady roan, steady!  The hail\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Just see that piece of ice in your horse's mane!  It's as large as a\n",

       "scarcely more than loop-holes, pierced in two sides.  The tap-room itself\n",
       "looked like the cabin of a ship.  Ceiling and floor, chairs and tables,\n",

       "beds were ranged like berths.\n",
       "\n",
       "The host, with many bows, came forward to receive the aristocratic\n",

       "glimmering.  The heat they sent forth answered several purposes at the\n",
       "same time.  It warmed the air, lighted a portion of the room, which was\n",
       "very dark in rainy weather, and served to cook three fowl that, suspended\n",

       "\n",
       "As the new guests approached the hearth, an old woman, who had been\n",

       "just perceived that the \"Glippers\" cloaks were hanging by the fire, while\n",
       "his friend's and his own were flung on a bench.  This fact seemed to\n",
       "greatly irritate the Leyden burgher; for as the baron rose, he pushed his\n",

       "arms on the edge of the table opposite to him and, with a jerking motion,\n",
       "turned his soldierly face sometimes towards the baron, and sometimes\n",

Transition to a character who initially displays a lighthearted demeanor but quickly shifts to a grave expression upon hearing the exclamation. Describe this character’s physical response, such as taking a deep breath, before they speak. Use elevated vocabulary and precise language to convey the weight of the moment. Maintain a historical or classical atmosphere, with complex sentence structures that balance dialogue and description. Keep the paragraph concise but rich in detail, ensuring the reader feels the shift in mood and the gravity of the situation.

       "manner be so faithful an index to my impressions?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I know the signs of the visitation,\" returned the stranger, gravely;\n",
       "\"they are not to be mistaken by one of my experience.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "All the gentlemen present then declared that they could comprehend, and\n",
       "had felt, what the stranger had described.  \"According to one of our\n",
       "national superstitions,\" said Merton, the Englishman who had first\n",
       "addressed Glyndon, \"the moment you so feel your blood creep, and your\n",
       "hair stand on end, some one is walking over the spot which shall be your\n",
       "grave.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There are in all lands different superstitions to account for so common\n",
       "an occurrence,\" replied the stranger; \"one sect among the Arabians hold\n",
       "that at that instant God is deciding the hour either of your death or\n",
       "that of some one dear to you.  The African savage, whose imagination is\n",
       "darkened by the hideous rites of his gloomy idolatry, believes that the\n",
       "Evil Spirit is pulling you towards him by the hair.  So do the Grotesque\n",
       "and the Terrible mingle with each other.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is evidently a mere physical accident,--a derangement of the\n",
       "stomach; a chill of the blood,\" said a young Neapolitan.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then why is it always coupled, in all nations, with some superstitious\n",
       "presentiment or terror,--some connection between the material frame and\n",
       "the supposed world without us?\" asked the stranger.  \"For my part, I\n",
       "think--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What do you think, sir?\" asked Glyndon, curiously.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I think,\" continued the stranger, \"that it is the repugnance and horror\n",
       "of that which is human about us to something indeed invisible, but\n",
       "antipathetic to our own nature, and from a knowledge of which we are\n",
       "happily secured by the imperfection of our senses.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are a believer in spirits, then?\" asked Merton, with an incredulous\n",
       "smile.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nay, I said not so.  I can form no notion of a spirit, as the\n",
       "metaphysicians do, and certainly have no fear of one; but there may be\n",
       "forms of matter as invisible and impalpable to us as the animalculae to\n",
       "which I have compared them.  The monster that lives and dies in a drop\n",
       "of water, carniverous, insatiable, subsisting on the creatures minuter\n",
       "than himself, is not less deadly in his wrath, less ferocious in his\n",
       "nature, than the tiger of the desert.  There may be things around us\n",
       "malignant and hostile to men, if Providence had not placed a wall\n",
       "between them and us, merely by different modifications of matter.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And could that wall never be removed?\" asked young Glyndon, abruptly.\n",
       "\"Are the traditions of sorcerer and wizard, universal and immemorial as\n",
       "they are, merely fables?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perhaps yes; perhaps no,\" answered the stranger, indifferently.  \"But\n",
       "who, in an age in which the reason has chosen its proper bounds, would\n",
       "be mad enough to break the partition that divides him from the boa and\n",
       "the lion, to repine at and rebel against the law of nature which\n",
       "confines the shark to the great deep?  Enough of these idle\n",
       "speculations.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Here the stranger rose, summoned the attendant, paid for his sherbet,\n",
       "and, bowing slightly to the company, soon disappeared among the trees.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who is that gentleman?\" asked Glyndon, eagerly.\n",
       "\n",
       "The rest looked at each other, without replying, for some moments.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I never saw him before,\" said Merton, at last.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nor I.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nor I.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have met him often,\" said the Neapolitan, who was named Count Cetoxa;\n",
       "\"it was, if you remember, as my companion that he joined you.  He has\n",
       "been some months at Naples; he is very rich,--indeed enormously so.  Our\n",
       "acquaintance commenced in a strange way.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How was it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I had been playing at a public gaming-house, and had lost considerably.\n",
       "I rose from the table, resolved no longer to tempt Fortune, when this\n",
       "gentleman, who had hitherto been a spectator, laying his hand on my arm,\n",
       "said with politeness, 'Sir, I see you enjoy play,--I dislike it; but I\n",
       "yet wish to have some interest in what is going on.  Will you play this\n",
       "sum for me?  The risk is mine,--the half-profits yours.'  I was\n",
       "startled, as you may suppose, at such an address; but the stranger had\n",
       "an air and tone with him it was impossible to resist.  Besides, I was\n",
       "burning to recover my losses, and should not have risen had I had any\n",
       "money left about me.  I told him I would accept his offer, provided we\n",
       "shared the risk as well as profits.  'As you will,' said he, smiling,\n",
       "'we need have no scruple, for you will be sure to win.'  I sat down, the\n",
       "stranger stood behind me; my luck rose, I invariably won.  In fact, I\n",
       "rose from the table a rich man.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There can be no foul play at the public tables, especially when foul\n",
       "play would make against the bank.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certainly not,\" replied the count.  \"But our good fortune was indeed\n",
       "marvellous,--so extraordinary that a Sicilian (the Sicilians are all\n",
       "ill-bred, bad-tempered fellows) grew angry and insolent.  'Sir,' said\n",
       "he, turning to my new friend, 'you have no business to stand so near to\n",
       "the table.  I do not understand this; you have not acted fairly.'  The\n",
       "spectator replied, with great composure, that he had done nothing\n",
       "against the rules; that he was very sorry that one man could not win\n",
       "without another man losing; and that he could not act unfairly even if\n",
       "disposed to do so.  The Sicilian took the stranger's mildness for\n",
       "apprehension,--blustered more loudly, and at length fairly challenged\n",
       "him.  'I never seek a quarrel, and I never shun a danger,' returned my\n",
       "partner; and six or seven of us adjourned to the garden behind the\n",
       "house.  I was of course my partner's second.  He took me aside.  'This\n",
       "man will die,' said he; 'see that he is buried privately in the church\n",
       "of St. Januario, by the side of his father.'\n",
       "\n",
       "\"'Did you know his family?' I asked with great surprise.  He made no\n",
       "answer, but drew his sword and walked deliberately to the spot we had\n",
       "selected.  The Sicilian was a renowned swordsman; nevertheless, in the\n",
       "third pass he was run through the body.  I went up to him; he could\n",
       "scarcely speak.  'Have you any request to make,--any affairs to settle?'\n",
       "He shook his head.  'Where would you wish to be interred?'  He pointed\n",
       "towards the Sicilian coast.  'What!' said I, in surprise, 'not by the\n",
       "side of your father?'  As I spoke, his face altered terribly, he uttered\n",
       "a piercing shriek; the blood gushed from his mouth, and he fell dead.\n",
       "The most strange part of the story is to come.  We buried him in the\n",
       "church of St. Januario.  In doing so, we took up his father's coffin;\n",
       "the lid came off in moving it, and the skeleton was visible.  In the\n",
       "hollow of the skull we found a very slender wire of sharp steel; this\n",
       "caused great surprise and inquiry.  The father, who was rich and a\n",
       "miser, had died suddenly and been buried in haste, owing, it was said,\n",
       "to the heat of the weather.  Suspicion once awakened, the examination\n",
       "became minute.  The old man's servant was questioned, and at last\n",
       "confessed that the son had murdered the sire.  The contrivance was\n",
       "ingenious; the wire was so slender that it pierced to the brain and drew\n",
       "but one drop of blood, which the gray hairs concealed.  The accomplice\n",
       "was executed.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And this stranger, did he give evidence?  Did he account for--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No,\" interrupted the count, \"he declared that he had by accident\n",
       "visited the church that morning; that he had observed the tombstone of\n",
       "the Count Salvolio; that his guide had told him the count's son was in\n",
       "Naples,--a spendthrift and a gambler.  While we were at play, he had\n",
       "heard the count mentioned by name at the table; and when the challenge\n",
       "was given and accepted, it had occured to him to name the place of\n",
       "burial, by an instinct he could not account for.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A very lame story,\" said Merton.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, but we Italians are superstitious.  The alleged instinct was\n",
       "regarded as the whisper of Providence; the stranger became an object of\n",
       "universal interest and curiosity.  His wealth, his manner of living, his\n",
       "extraordinary personal beauty, have assisted also to make him the rage.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What is his name?\" asked Glyndon.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Zicci.  Signor Zicci.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is it not an Italian name?  He speaks English like a native.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"So he does French and German, as well as Italian, to my knowledge.  But\n",
       "he declares himself a Corsican by birth, though I cannot hear of any\n",
       "eminent Corsican family of that name.  However, what matters his birth\n",
       "or parentage?  He is rich, generous, and the best swordsman I ever saw\n",
       "in my life.  Who would affront him?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not I, certainly,\" said Merton, rising.  \"Come, Glyndon, shall we seek\n",
       "our hotel?  It is almost daylight.  Adieu, signor.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What think you of this story?\" said Glyndon as the young men walked\n",
       "homeward.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why, it is very clear that this Zicci is some impostor, some clever\n",
       "rogue; and the Neapolitan shares booty, and puffs him off with all the\n",
       "hackneyed charlatanism of the marvellous.  An unknown adventurer gets\n",
       "into society by being made an object of awe and curiosity; he is\n",
       "devilish handsome; and the women are quite content to receive him\n",
       "without any other recommendation than his own face and Cetoxa's fables.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I cannot agree with you.  Cetoxa, though a gambler and a rake, is a\n",
       "nobleman of birth and high repute for courage and honor.  Besides, this\n",
       "stranger, with his grand features and lofty air,--so calm, so\n",
       "unobtrusive,--has nothing in common with the forward garrulity of an\n",
       "impostor.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear Glyndon, pardon me, but you have not yet acquired any knowledge\n",
       "of the world; the stranger makes the best of a fine person, and his\n",
       "grand air is but a trick of the trade.  But to change the subject: how\n",
       "gets on the love affair?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! Isabel could not see me to-night.  The old woman gave me a note of\n",
       "excuse.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You must not marry her; what would they all say at home?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Let us enjoy the present,\" said Glyndon, with vivacity; \"we are young,\n",
       "rich, good-looking: let us not think of to-morrow.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Bravo, Glyndon!  Here we are at the hotel.  Sleep sound, and don't\n",

       "CHAPTER II.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Clarence Glyndon was a young man of small but independent fortune.  He\n",
       "had, early in life, evinced considerable promise in the art of painting,\n",
       "and rather from enthusiasm than the want of a profession, he had\n",
       "resolved to devote himself to a career which in England has been seldom\n",
       "entered upon by persons who can live on their own means.  Without being\n",
       "a poet, Glyndon had also manifested a graceful faculty for verse, which\n",
       "had contributed to win his entry into society above his birth.  Spoiled\n",
       "and flattered from his youth upward, his natural talents were in some\n",
       "measure relaxed by indolence and that worldly and selfish habit of\n",
       "thought which frivolous companionship often engenders, and which is\n",
       "withering alike to stern virtue and high genius.  The luxuriance of his\n",
       "fancy was unabated; but the affections, which are the life of fancy, had\n",
       "grown languid and inactive.  His youth, his vanity, and a restless\n",
       "daring and thirst of adventure had from time to time involved him in\n",
       "dangers and dilemmas, out of which, of late, he had always extricated\n",
       "himself with the ingenious felicity of a clever head and cool heart.  He\n",
       "had left England for Rome with the avowed purpose and sincere resolution\n",
       "of studying the divine masterpieces of art; but pleasure had soon\n",
       "allured him from ambition, and he quitted the gloomy palaces of Rome for\n",
       "the gay shores and animated revelries of Naples.  Here he had fallen in\n",
       "love--deeply in love, as he said and thought--with a young person\n",
       "celebrated at Naples, Isabel di Pisani.  She was the only daughter of an\n",
       "Italian by an English mother.  The father had known better days; in his\n",
       "prosperity he had travelled, and won in England the affections of a lady\n",
       "of some fortune.  He had been induced to speculate; he lost his all; he\n",
       "settled at Naples, and taught languages and music.  His wife died when\n",
       "Isabel, christened from her mother, was ten years old.  At sixteen she\n",
       "came out on the stage; two years afterwards her father departed this\n",
       "life, and Isabel was an orphan.\n",
       "\n",
       "Glyndon, a man of pleasure and a regular attendant at the theatre, had\n",
       "remarked the young actress behind the scenes; he fell in love with her,\n",
       "and he told her so.  The girl listened to him, perhaps from vanity,\n",
       "perhaps from ambition, perhaps from coquetry; she listened, and allowed\n",
       "but few stolen interviews, in which she permitted no favor to the\n",
       "Englishman it was one reason why he loved her so much.\n",
       "\n",
       "The day following that on which our story opens, Glyndon was riding\n",
       "alone by the shores of the Neapolitan sea, on the other side of the\n",
       "Cavern of Pausilippo.  It was past noon; the sun had lost its early\n",
       "fervor, and a cool breeze sprang voluptuously from the sparkling sea.\n",
       "Bending over a fragment of stone near the roadside, he perceived the\n",
       "form of a man; and when he approached he recognized Zicci.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Englishman saluted him courteously.  \"Have you discovered some\n",
       "antique?\" said he, with a smile; \"they are as common as pebbles on this\n",
       "road.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No,\" replied Zicci; \"it was but one of those antiques that have their\n",
       "date, indeed, from the beginning of the world, but which Nature\n",
       "eternally withers and renews.\"  So saying, he showed Glyndon a small\n",
       "herb with a pale blue flower, and then placed it carefully in his bosom.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are an herbalist?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is, I am told, a study full of interest.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To those who understand it, doubtless.  But,\" continued Zicci, looking\n",
       "up with a slight and cold smile, \"why do you linger on your way to\n",
       "converse with me on matters in which you neither have knowledge nor\n",
       "desire to obtain it?  I read your heart, young Englishman: your\n",
       "curiosity is excited; you wish to know me, and not this humble herb.\n",
       "Pass on; your desire never can be satisfied.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have not the politeness of your countrymen,\" said Glyndon, somewhat\n",
       "discomposed.  \"Suppose I were desirous to cultivate your acquaintance,\n",
       "why should you reject my advances?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I reject no man's advances,\" answered Zicci.  \"I must know them, if\n",
       "they so desire; but me, in return, they can never comprehend.  If you\n",
       "ask my acquaintance, it is yours; but I would warn you to shun me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And why are you then so dangerous?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Some have found me so; if I were to predict your fortune by the vain\n",
       "calculations of the astrologer, I should tell you, in their despicable\n",
       "jargon, that my planet sat darkly in your house of life.  Cross me not,\n",
       "if you can avoid it.  I warn you now for the first time and last.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You despise the astrologers, yet you utter a jargon as mysterious as\n",
       "theirs.  I neither gamble nor quarrel: why then should I fear you?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"As you will; I have done.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Let me speak frankly: your conversation last night interested and\n",
       "amused me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I know it; minds like yours are attracted by mystery.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Glyndon was piqued at those words, though in the tone in which they were\n",
       "spoken there was no contempt.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I see you do not consider me worthy of your friendship be it so.  Good\n",
       "day.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Zicci coldly replied to the salutation, and as the Englishman rode on,\n",
       "returned to his botanical employment.\n",
       "\n",
       "The same night Glyndon went, as usual, to the theatre.  He was standing\n",
       "behind the scenes watching Isabel, who was on the stage in one of her\n",
       "most brilliant parts.  The house resounded with applause.  Glyndon was\n",
       "transported with a young man's passion and a young man's pride.  \"This\n",
       "glorious creature,\" thought he, \"may yet be mine.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He felt, while thus rapt in delicious revery, a slight touch upon his\n",
       "shoulder; he turned, and beheld Zicci.  \"You are in danger,\" said the\n",
       "latter.  \"Do not walk home to-night; or if you do, go not alone.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Before Glyndon recovered from his surprise, Zicci disappeared; and when\n",
       "the Englishman saw him again, he was in the box of one of the Neapolitan\n",
       "ministers, where Glyndon could not follow him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Isabel now left the stage, and Glyndon accosted her with impassioned\n",
       "gallantry.  The actress was surprisingly beautiful; of fair complexion\n",
       "and golden hair, her countenance was relieved from the tame and gentle\n",
       "loveliness which the Italians suppose to be the characteristics of\n",
       "English beauty, by the contrast of dark eyes and lashes, by a forehead\n",
       "of great height, to which the dark outline of the eyebrows gave some\n",
       "thing of majesty and command.  In spite of the slightness of virgin\n",
       "youth, her proportions had the nobleness, blent with the delicacy, that\n",
       "belongs to the masterpieces of ancient sculpture; and there was a\n",
       "conscious pride in her step, and in the swanlike bend of her stately\n",
       "head, as she turned with an evident impatience from the address of her\n",
       "lover.  Taking aside an old woman, who was her constant and confidential\n",
       "attendant at the theatre, she said, in an earnest whisper,--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, Gionetta, he is here again!  I have seen him again!  And again, he\n",
       "alone of the whole theatre withholds from me his applause.  He scarcely\n",
       "seems to notice me; his indifference mortifies me to the soul,--I could\n",
       "weep for rage and sorrow.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Which is he, my darling?\" said the old woman, with fondness in her\n",
       "voice.  \"He must be dull,--not worth thy thoughts.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The actress drew Gionetta nearer to the stage, and pointed out to her a\n",
       "man in one of the nearer boxes, conspicuous amongst all else by the\n",
       "simplicity of his dress and the extraordinary beauty of his features.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not worth a thought, Gionetta,\" repeated Isabel,--\"not worth a thought!\n",
       "Saw you ever one so noble, so godlike?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"By the Holy Mother!\" answered Gionetta, \"he is a proper man, and has\n",
       "the air of a prince.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The prompter summoned the Signora Pisani.  \"Find out his name,\n",

       "breathless worship, but the eyes of Isabel sought only those of one calm\n",
       "and unmoved spectator; she exerted herself as if inspired.  The stranger\n",
       "listened, and observed her with an attentive gaze, but no approval\n",
       "escaped his lips, no emotion changed the expression of his cold and\n",
       "half-disdainful aspect.  Isabel, who was in the character of a jealous\n",
       "and abandoned mistress, never felt so acutely the part she played.  Her\n",
       "tears were truthful; her passion that of nature: it was almost too\n",
       "terrible to behold.  She was borne from the stage, exhausted and\n",
       "insensible, amidst such a tempest of admiring rapture as Continental\n",
       "audiences alone can raise.  The crowd stood up, handkerchiefs waved,\n",
       "garlands and flowers were thrown on the stage, men wiped their eyes, and\n",

       "handy to her lover, who kissed it with delight.  Gionetta and her charge\n",
       "entered the carriage, and Glyndon was left at the door of the theatre,\n",
       "to return home on foot.  The mysterious warning of Zicci then suddenly\n",
       "occurred to him; he had forgotten it in the interest of his lover's\n",
       "quarrel with Isabel.  He thought it now advisable to guard against\n",
       "danger foretold by lips so mysterious; he looked round for some one he\n",
       "knew.  The theatre was disgorging its crowds, who hustled and jostled\n",

       "\"Fear not, fairest Pisani,\" said he, gently, \"no ill shall befall you.\"\n",
       "As he spoke, he wound his arms round the form of the fair actress, and\n",
       "endeavored to lift her from the carriage.  But the Signora Pisani was\n",
       "not an ordinary person; she had been before exposed to all the dangers\n",
       "to which the beauty of the low-born was subjected amongst a lawless and\n",
       "profligate nobility.  She thrust back the assailant with a power that\n",

       "showed the noble features of Zicci.  \"Be calm, be hushed; I can save\n",
       "you.\"  He vanished, leaving Isabel lost in surprise, agitation, and\n",
       "delight.  There were in all nine masks: two were engaged with the\n",

       "to the side of the road.  To these Zicci motioned: they advanced; he\n",

       "yourself to your shame, you would never enter the world again to tell\n",
       "your tale.  The ravisher has no heart for repentance, but he has a\n",
       "hand that can murder.  I have saved thee, Isabel di Pisani.  Perhaps\n",
       "you would ask me wherefore?\"  Zicci paused, and smiled mournfully as he\n",
       "added: \"My life is not that of others, but I am still human,--I know\n",
       "pity; and more, Isabel, I can feel gratitude for affection.  You love\n",
       "me; it was my fate to fascinate your eye, to arouse your vanity, to\n",
       "inflame your imagination.  It was to warn you from this folly that I\n",
       "consented for a few minutes to become your guest.  The Englishman,\n",

       "may pass through the brief period of your human life with a proud step\n",

       "neglected from your childhood; you have been thrown among nations at\n",

       "qualities, are not developed.  You were pleased with the admiration of\n",
       "Glyndon; you thought that the passionate stranger might marry you, while\n",
       "others had only uttered the vows that dishonor.  Poor child, it was the\n",
       "instinctive desire of right within thee that made thee listen to him;\n",
       "and if my fatal shadow had not crossed thy path, thou wouldst have loved\n",
       "him well enough, at least, for content.  Return to that hope, and nurse\n",

       "of the beautiful creature that now knelt before him, with all the\n",
       "passions of an ardent and pure, but wholly untutored and half-savage,\n",
       "nature speaking from the tearful eyes and trembling lips.  He looked at\n",
       "her with an aspect she could not interpret; in his eyes were kindness,\n",
       "sorrow, and even something, she thought, of love: yet the brow frowned,\n",
       "and the lip was stern.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is in vain that we struggle with our doom,\" said he, calmly; \"listen\n",

       "left, but whose life is, on the whole, devoted to a systematic and\n",
       "selfish desire to enjoy whatever life can afford.  To me it is given to\n",
       "warn: the warning neglected, I interfere no more; I leave her victories\n",
       "to that Fate that I cannot baffle of her prey.  You do not understand\n",

       "the daughters of men.  Yes, Isabel, I could love thee\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Isabel uttered a cry of joy, seized his hand, and kissed it through\n",

       "from every harm.\"  With these words he withdrew himself from her\n",
       "embrace, and had gained the outer door just as Gionetta came from the\n",
       "kitchen with her hands full of such cheer as she had managed to collect\n",

       "\n",
       "He ascended the vast staircase, and entered the rooms reserved for his\n",

       "He threw himself on a sofa, and dismissed his attendants for the night;\n",
       "and here it may be observed that Zicci had no one servant who knew\n",
       "anything of his origin, birth, or history.  Some of his attendants he\n",
       "had brought with him from other cities; the rest he had engaged at\n",

       "man who sought tools, and never made confidants.\n",
       "\n",

       "to make another effort to conciliate Zicci.\n",
       "\n",
       "The signor was at home, and Glyndon was admitted into a lofty saloon,\n",
       "where in a few moments Zicci joined him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am come to thank you for your warning last night,\" said he, \"and to\n",

       "which I may look for enmity and peril.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are a gallant, Mr. Glyndon,\" said Zicci, with a smile; \"and do you\n",
       "know so little of the South as not to be aware that gallants have always\n",
       "rivals?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Are you serious?\" said Glyndon, coloring.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Most serious.  You love Isabel di Pisani; you have for rival one of the\n",
       "most powerful and relentless of the Neapolitan princes.  Your danger is\n",
       "indeed great.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But, pardon me, how came it known to you?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I give no account of myself to mortal man,\" replied Zicci, haughtily;\n",
       "\"and to me it matters not whether you regard or scorn my warning.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, if I may not question you, be it so; but at least advise me what\n",
       "to do.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You will not follow my advice.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You wrong me!  Why?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Because you are constitutionally brave; you are fond of excitement and\n",
       "mystery; you like to be the hero of a romance.  I should advise you to\n",
       "leave Naples, and you will disdain to do so while Naples contains a foe\n",
       "to shun or a mistress to pursue.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are right,\" said the young Englishman, with energy; \"and you cannot\n",
       "reproach me for such a resolution.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, there is another course left to you.  Do you love Isabel di Pisani\n",
       "truly and fervently?  If so, marry her, and take a bride to your native\n",
       "land.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nay,\" answered Glyndon, embarrassed.  \"Isabel is not of my rank; her\n",
       "character is strange and self-willed; her education neglected.  I am\n",
       "enslaved by her beauty, but I cannot wed her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Zicci frowned.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Your love, then, is but selfish lust; and by that love you will be\n",
       "betrayed.  Young man, Destiny is less inexorable than it appears.  The\n",
       "resources of the great Ruler of the Universe are not so scanty and so\n",
       "stern as to deny to men the divine privilege of Free Will; all of us can\n",
       "carve out our own way, and God can make our very contradictions\n",
       "harmonize with His solemn ends.  You have before you an option.\n",
       "Honorable and generous love may even now work out your happiness and\n",
       "effect your escape; a frantic and interested passion will but lead you\n",
       "to misery and doom.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do you pretend, then, to read the Future?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have said all that it pleases me to utter.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"While you assume the moralist to me, Signor Zicci,\" said Glyndon, with\n",
       "a smile, \"if report says true you do not yourself reject the allurements\n",
       "of unfettered love.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If it were necessary that practice square with precept,\" said Zicci,\n",
       "with a sneer, \"our pulpits would be empty.  Do you think it matters, in\n",
       "the great aggregate of human destinies, what one man's conduct may be?\n",
       "Nothing,--not a grain of dust; but it matters much what are the\n",
       "sentiments he propagates.  His acts are limited and momentary; his\n",
       "sentiments may pervade the universe, and inspire generations till the\n",
       "day of doom.  All our virtues, all our laws, are drawn from books and\n",
       "maxims, which are sentiments, not from deeds.  Our opinions, young\n",
       "Englishman, are the angel part of us; our acts the earthly.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have reflected deeply, for an Italian,\" said Glyndon.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who told you I was an Italian?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Are you not of Corsica?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Tush!\" said Zicci, impatiently turning away.  Then, after a pause, he\n",
       "resumed, in a mild voice: \"Glyndon, do you renounce Isabel di Pisani?\n",
       "Will you take three days to consider of what I have said?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Renounce her,--never!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then you will marry her?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Impossible.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Be it so; she will then renounce you.  I tell you that you have\n",
       "rivals.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, the Prince di --; but I do not fear him.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\"And who is he?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Myself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Glyndon turned pale, and started from his seat.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You, Signor Zicci, you,--and you dare to tell me so?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Dare!  Alas! you know there is nothing on earth left me to fear!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "These words were not uttered arrogantly, but in a tone of the most\n",
       "mournful dejection.  Glyndon was enraged, confounded, and yet awed.\n",
       "However, he had a brave English heart within his breast, and he\n",
       "recovered himself quickly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Signor,\" said he, calmly, \"I am not to be duped by these solemn phrases\n",
       "and these mystical sympathies.  You may have power which I cannot\n",
       "comprehend or emulate, or you may be but a keen impostor.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, sir, your logical position is not ill-taken; proceed.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I mean  then,\" continued  Glyndon, resolutely, though somewhat\n",
       "disconcerted, \"I mean you to understand, that, though I am not to be\n",

       "\n",
       "Zicci looked gravely at the young man, whose sparkling eyes and\n",
       "heightened color testified the spirit to support his words, and replied:\n",
       "\"So bold! well, it becomes you.  You have courage, then; I thought it.\n",
       "Perhaps it may be put to a sharper test than you dream of.  But take my\n",
       "advice: wait three days, and tell me then if you will marry this young\n",

       "\n",
       "\"But if you love her, why, why--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why am I anxious that she should wed another?  To save her from myself!\n",
       "Listen to me.  That girl, humble and uneducated though she be, has in\n",
       "her the seeds of the most lofty qualities and virtues.  She can be all\n",
       "to the man she loves,--all that man can desire in wife or mistress.  Her\n",
       "soul, developed by affection, will elevate your own; it will influence\n",
       "your fortunes, exalt your destiny; you will become a great and\n",
       "prosperous man.  If, on the contrary, she fall to me, I know not what\n",
       "may be her lot; but I know that few can pass the ordeal, and hitherto no\n",
       "woman has survived the struggle.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "As Zicci spoke, his face became livid, and there was something in his\n",
       "voice that froze the warm blood of his listener.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What is this mystery which surrounds you?\" exclaimed Glyndon, unable to\n",
       "repress his emotion.  \"Are you, in truth, different from other men?\n",
       "Have you passed the boundary of lawful knowledge?  Are you, as some\n",
       "declare, a sorcerer, only a--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Hush!\" interrupted Zicci, gently, and with a smile of singular but\n",
       "melancholy sweetness: \"have you earned the right to ask me these\n",
       "questions?  The clays of torture and persecution are over; and a man may\n",
       "live as he pleases, and talk as it suits him, without fear of the stake\n",
       "and the rack.  Since I can defy persecution, pardon me if I do not\n",
       "succumb to curiosity.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Glyndon blushed, and rose.  In spite of his love for Isabel, and his\n",
       "natural terror of such a rival, he felt himself irresistibly drawn\n",
       "towards the very man he had most cause to suspect and dread.  It was\n",
       "like the fascination of the basilisk.  He held out his hand to Zicci,\n",
       "saying, \"Well, then, if we are to be rivals, our swords must settle our\n",
       "rights; till then I would fain be friends.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Friends!  Pardon me, I like you too well to give you my friendship.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Enigmas!\" cried Zicci, passionately, \"Nay: can you dare to solve them!\n",
       "Would you brave all that human heart can conceive of peril and of\n",
       "horror, so that you at last might stand separated from this visible\n",
       "universe side by side with me?  When you can dare this, and when you are\n",

       "had said to him relative to Isabel.  His imagination was inflamed by the\n",
       "vague and splendid promises that were connected with his marriage with\n",
       "the poor actress.  His fears, too, were naturally aroused by the threat\n",
       "that by marriage alone could he save himself from the rivalry of Zicci,\n",
       "--Zicci, born to dazzle and command; Zicci, who united to the apparent\n",

       "a foe!\n",
       "\n",
       "But Glyndon's pride, as well as jealousy, was aroused.  He was brave\n",

       "mortal as himself?  And why should Zicci desire him to give his name and\n",
       "station to one of a calling so equivocal?  Might there not be motives he\n",
       "could not fathom?  Might not the actress and the Corsican be in league\n",

       "that Isabel was not the base and guilty thing he had dared for a moment\n",
       "to suspect her.  Lost in a labyrinth of doubts and surmises, Glyndon\n",

       "\n",

       "the abstraction of her mind.  Her beautiful hair was gathered up\n",
       "loosely, and partially bandaged by a kerchief, whose purple color seemed\n",

       "(and, oh! at times it is one of delirious and vague delight, at others\n",

       "It was the day on which Zicci had told Glyndon that he should ask for\n",
       "his decision in respect to Isabel,--the third day since their last\n",
       "meeting.  The Englishman could not come to a resolution.  Ambition,\n",
       "hitherto the leading passion of his soul, could not yet be silenced by\n",
       "love, and that love, such as it was, unreturned, beset by suspicions and\n",
       "doubts which vanished in the presence of Isabel, and returned when her\n",
       "bright face shone on his eyes no more, for les absents ont toujours\n",
       "tort.  Perhaps had he been quite alone, his feelings of honor, of\n",
       "compassion, of virtue, might have triumphed, and he would have resolved\n",
       "either to fly from Isabel or to offer the love that has no shame.  But\n",
       "Merton, cold, cautious, experienced, wary (such a nature has ever power\n",
       "over the imaginative and the impassioned), was at hand to ridicule the\n",
       "impression produced by Zicci, and the notion of delicacy and honor\n",
       "towards an Italian actress.  It is true that Merton, who was no\n",
       "profligate, advised him to quit all pursuit of Isabel; but then the\n",
       "advice was precisely of that character which, if it deadens love,\n",
       "stimulates passion.  By representing Isabel as one who sought to play a\n",
       "part with him, he excused to Glyndon his own selfishness,--he enlisted\n",
       "the Englishman's vanity and pride on the side of his pursuit.  Why\n",
       "should not he beat an adventuress at her own weapons?\n",
       "\n",
       "Glyndon not only felt indisposed on that day to meet Zicci, but he felt\n",
       "also a strong desire to defeat the mysterious prophecy that the meeting\n",
       "should take place.  Into this wish Merton readily entered.  The young\n",
       "men agreed to be absent from Naples that day.  Early in the morning they\n",
       "mounted their horses and took the road to Baiae.  Glyndon left word at\n",
       "his hotel that if Signor Zicci sought him, it was in the neighborhood of\n",
       "the once celebrated watering-place of the ancients that he should be\n",
       "found.\n",
       "\n",
       "They passed by Isabel's house; but Glyndon resisted the temptation of\n",
       "pausing there, and threading the grotto of Pausilippo, they wound by a\n",
       "circuitous route back into the suburbs of the city, and took the\n",
       "opposite road, which conducts to Portici and Pompeii.  It was late at\n",
       "noon when they arrived at the former of these places.  Here they halted\n",
       "to dine; for Merton had heard much of the excellence of the macaroni at\n",
       "Portici, and Merton was a bon vivant.\n",
       "\n",
       "They put up at an inn of very humble pretensions, and dined under an\n",
       "awning.  Merton was more than usually gay; he pressed the lacryma upon\n",
       "his friend, and conversed gayly.  \"Well, my dear friend, we have foiled\n",

       "prettier still after sunset.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A capital idea,\" cried Merton.  \"What say you, Glyndon?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have not yet seen an eruption; I should like it much.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But is there no danger?\" said the prudent Merton.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! not at all; the mountain is very civil at present.  It only plays a\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Well, order the horses, and bring the bill; we will go before it is\n",

       "\n",
       "The wine animated Glyndon, whose unequal spirits were at times high and\n",
       "brilliant as those of a school-boy released; and the laughter of the\n",
       "Northern tourists sounded oft and merrily along the melancholy domains\n",
       "of buried cities.\n",
       "\n",
       "Hesperus had lighted his lamp amidst the rosy skies as they arrived at\n",
       "Resina.  Here they quitted their horses and took mules and a guide.\n",
       "As the sky grew darker and more dark, the Mountain Fire burned with an\n",
       "intense lustre.  In various streaks and streamlets the fountain of flame\n",
       "rolled down the dark summit, then undiminished by the eruption of 1822,\n",
       "and the Englishmen began to feel increase upon them, as they ascended,\n",
       "that sensation of solemnity and awe which makes the very atmosphere that\n",
       "surrounds the giant of the Plains of the Antique Hades.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was night when, leaving the mules, they ascended on foot, accompanied\n",
       "by their guide and a peasant, who bore a rude torch.  Their guide was a\n",
       "conversable, garrulous fellow, like most of his country and his calling;\n",
       "and Merton, whose chief characteristics were a sociable temper and a\n",
       "hardy commonsense, loved to amuse or to instruct himself on every\n",
       "incidental occasion.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, Excellency,\" said the guide, \"your countrymen have a strong passion\n",
       "for the volcano.  Long life to them; they bring us plenty of money.  If\n",
       "our fortunes depended on the Neapolitans, we should starve.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"True, they have no curiosity,\" said Merton.  \"Do you remember, Glyndon,\n",
       "the contempt with which that old count said to us, 'You will go to\n",
       "Vesuvius, I suppose.  I have never been: why should I go?  You have\n",
       "cold, you have hunger, you have fatigue, you have danger, and all for\n",
       "nothing but to see fire, which looks just as well in a brazier as a\n",
       "mountain.' Ha! ha! the old fellow was right.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But, Excellency,\" said the guide, \"that is not all: some cavaliers\n",
       "think to ascend the mountain without our help.  I am sure they deserve\n",
       "to tumble into the crater.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"They must be bold fellows to go alone: you don't often find such?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Sometimes among the French, signor.  But the other night--I never was\n",
       "so frightened.  I had been with an English party, and a lady had left a\n",
       "pocket-book on the mountain where she had been sketching.  She offered\n",
       "me a handsome sum to return for it, and bring it to her at Naples; so I\n",
       "went in the evening.  I found it sure enough, and was about to return,\n",
       "when I saw a figure that seemed to emerge from the crater itself.  The\n",
       "air was so pestiferous that I could not have conceived a human creature\n",
       "could breathe it and live.  I was so astounded that I stood as still as\n",
       "a stone, till the figure came over the hot ashes and stood before me\n",
       "face to face.  Sancta Maria, what a head!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What, hideous?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, so beautiful, but so terrible.  It had nothing human in its\n",
       "aspect.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And what said the salamander?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nothing!  It did not even seem to perceive me, though I was as near as\n",
       "I am to you; but its eyes seemed prying into the air.  It passed by me\n",
       "quickly, and, walking across a stream of burning lava, soon vanished on\n",
       "the other side of the mountain.  I was curious and foolhardy, and\n",
       "resolved to see if I could bear the atmosphere which this visitor had\n",
       "left; but though I did not advance within thirty yards of the spot at\n",
       "which he had first appeared, I was driven back by a vapor that well-nigh\n",
       "stifled me.  Cospetto!  I have spit blood ever since.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It must be Zicci,\" whispered Glyndon.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I knew you would say so,\" returned Merton, laughing.\n",
       "\n",
       "The little party had now arrived nearly at the summit of the mountain;\n",
       "and unspeakably grand was the spectacle on which they gazed.  From the\n",
       "crater arose a vapor, intensely dark, that overspread the whole\n",
       "background of the heavens, in the centre whereof rose a flame that\n",
       "assumed a form singularly beautiful.  It might have been compared to a\n",
       "crest of gigantic feathers, the diadem of the mountain, high arched, and\n",
       "drooping downward, with the hues delicately shaded off, and the whole\n",
       "shifting and tremulous as the plumage on a warrior's helm.  The glare of\n",
       "the flame spread, luminous and crimson, over the dark and rugged ground\n",
       "on which they stood, and drew an innumerable variety of shadows from\n",
       "crag and hollow.  An oppressive and sulphureous exhalation served to\n",
       "increase the gloomy and sublime terror of the place.  But on turning\n",
       "from the mountain, and towards the distant and unseen ocean, the\n",
       "contrast was wonderfully great: the heavens serene and blue, the stars\n",
       "still and calm as the eyes of Divine Love.  It was as if the realms of\n",
       "the opposing principles of Evil and Good were brought in one view before\n",
       "the gaze of man!  Glyndon--the enthusiast, the poet, the artist, the\n",
       "dreamer--was enchained and entranced by emotions vague and undefinable,\n",
       "half of delight and half of pain.  Leaning on the shoulder of his\n",
       "friend, he gazed around him, and heard, with deepening awe, the rumbling\n",
       "of the earth below, the wheels and voices of the Ministry of Nature in\n",
       "her darkest and most inscrutable recess.  Suddenly, as a bomb from a\n",
       "shell, a huge stone was flung hundreds of yards up from the jaws of the\n",
       "crater, and falling with a mighty crash upon the rock below, split into\n",
       "ten thousand fragments, which bounded down the sides of the mountain,\n",
       "sparkling and groaning as they went.  One of these, the largest\n",
       "fragment, struck the narrow space of soil between the Englishman and the\n",
       "guide, not three feet from the spot where the former stood.  Merton\n",
       "uttered an exclamation of terror, and Glyndon held his breath and\n",
       "shuddered.  \"Diavolo!\"  cried the guide; \"descend, Excellencies,\n",
       "descend!  We have not a moment to lose; follow me close.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "So saying, the guide and the peasant fled with as much swiftness as they\n",
       "were able to bring to bear.  Merton, ever more prompt and ready than his\n",
       "friend, imitated their example; and Glyndon, more confused than alarmed,\n",
       "followed close.  But they had not gone many yards before, with a rushing\n",
       "and sudden blast, came from the crater an enormous volume of vapor.  It\n",
       "pursued, it overtook, it overspread them; it swept the light from the\n",
       "heavens.  All was abrupt and utter darkness, and through the gloom was\n",
       "heard the shout of the guide, already distant, and lost in an instant\n",
       "amidst the sound of the rushing gust and the groans of the earth\n",
       "beneath.  Glyndon paused.  He was separated from his friend, from the\n",
       "guide.  He was alone with the Darkness and the Terror.  The vapor rolled\n",
       "sullenly away; the form of the plumed fire was again dimly visible, and\n",
       "its struggling and perturbed reflection again shed a glow over the\n",
       "horrors of the path.  Glyndon recovered himself, and sped onward.\n",
       "Below, he heard the voice of Merton calling on him, though he no longer\n",
       "saw his form.  The sound served as a guide.  Dizzy and breathless, he\n",
       "bounded forward, when hark! a sullen, slow, rolling sound in his ear!\n",
       "He halted, and turned back to gaze.  The fire had overflowed its course;\n",
       "it had opened itself a channel amidst the furrows of the mountain.  The\n",
       "stream pursued him fast, fast, and the hot breath of the chasing and\n",
       "preternatural foe came closer and closer upon his cheek.  He turned\n",
       "aside; he climbed desperately, with hands and feet, upon a crag that, to\n",
       "the right, broke the scathed and blasted level of the soil.  The stream\n",
       "rolled beside and beneath him, and then, taking a sudden wind round the\n",
       "spot on which he stood, interposed its liquid fire--a broad and\n",
       "impassable barrier--between his resting-place and escape.  There he\n",
       "stood, cut off from descent, and with no alternative but to retrace his\n",
       "steps towards the crater, and thence seek--without guide or clew--some\n",
       "other pathway.\n",
       "\n",
       "For a moment his courage left him; he cried in despair, and in that\n",
       "over-strained pitch of voice which is never heard afar off, to the\n",
       "guide, to Merton, to return, to aid him.\n",
       "\n",
       "No answer came; and the Englishman, thus abandoned solely to his own\n",
       "resources, felt his spirit and energy rise against the danger.  He\n",
       "turned back, and ventured as far towards the crater as the noxious\n",
       "exhalation would permit; then, gazing below, carefully and deliberately\n",
       "he chalked out for himself a path, by which he trusted to shun the\n",
       "direction the fire-stream had taken, and trod firmly and quickly over\n",
       "the crumbling and heated strata.\n",
       "\n",
       "He had proceeded about fifty yards when he halted abruptly: an\n",
       "unspeakable and unaccountable horror, not hitherto felt amidst all his\n",
       "peril, came over him.  He shook in every limb; his muscles refused his\n",
       "will; he felt, as it were, palsied and death-stricken.  The horror, I\n",
       "say, was unaccountable, for the path seemed clear and safe.  The fire,\n",
       "above and behind, burned out clear and far; and beyond, the stars lent\n",
       "him their cheering guidance.  No obstacle was visible, no danger seemed\n",
       "at hand.  As thus, spell-bound and panic-stricken, he stood chained to\n",
       "the soil--his breast heaving, large drops rolling down his brow, and his\n",
       "eyes starting wildly from their sockets--he saw before him, at some\n",
       "distance, gradually shaping itself more and more distinctly to his gaze,\n",
       "a Colossal Shadow,--a shadow that seemed partially borrowed from the\n",
       "human shape, but immeasurably above the human stature, vague, dark,\n",
       "almost formless and differing--he could not tell where or why--not only\n",
       "from the proportions, but also from the limbs and outline of man.\n",
       "\n",
       "The glare of the volcano, that seemed to shrink and collapse from this\n",
       "gigantic and appalling apparition, nevertheless threw its light, redly\n",
       "and steadily, upon another shape that stood beside, quiet and\n",
       "motionless; and it was perhaps the contrast of these two things--the\n",
       "Being and the Shadow--that impressed the beholder with the difference\n",
       "between them,--the Man and the Superhuman.  It was but for a moment,\n",
       "nay, for the tenth part of a moment, that this sight was permitted to\n",
       "the wanderer.  A second eddy of sulphureous vapors from the volcano, yet\n",
       "more rapidly, yet more densely than its predecessor, rolled over the\n",
       "mountain; and either the nature of the exhalation, or the excess of his\n",
       "own dread, was such that Glyndon, after one wild gasp for breath, fell\n",
       "senseless on the earth.\n",

The paragraph should explore the idea of invisible and intangible forms of matter that may exist around us, drawing a comparison between these unseen entities and microscopic organisms. Emphasize the potential danger and ferocity of such entities, likening them to predatory animals like tigers, and suggest that they could be hostile to humans if not for a protective barrier established by a higher power. Use complex, multi-clause sentences to convey depth of thought, and employ elevated vocabulary to maintain a scholarly tone. Incorporate metaphors and analogies to enhance the imagery and philosophical nature of the text. The paragraph should be approximately 150-200 words long, with a focus on speculative reasoning and a sense of wonder about the unknown aspects of the natural world. Avoid direct references to specific philosophical or scientific concepts, instead framing the discussion in a more general and imaginative manner."

       "that the people, wearied out by their own criticisms, were beginning\n",
       "to scatter; that at length they conceived the idea of sending a\n",
       "Committee on an exploring tour, which Committee, going to hear a city\n",
       "preacher, heard in his place a young man lately graduated from the\n",
       "divinity school; that they were so impressed with his heartiness in\n",
       "his work they requested an introduction and invited him to add one\n",
       "more to the number of competing candidates; that he politely but\n",
       "firmly declined, not believing, this the proper method of obtaining a\n",
       "clergyman that, after making inquiries of his Professors and others,\n",
       "and receiving instructions to go forward from the church at home, the\n",

       "\n",
       "His arrival in the town, which I shall call Grantbury, late on\n",
       "Saturday evening, had given the family little opportunity for forming\n",
       "an opinion of the new pastor; that he was tall and vigorous in frame,\n",
       "with a countenance sad rather than smiling, eyes looking far away, a\n",
       "sweet, musical voice with a sad note running through it, was all that\n",
       "they knew of him until they took their seats in church directly in\n",
       "front of the pulpit. The sermon was on Christ's invitation to the\n",
       "weary and heavy laden to come to him for rest. In the most graphic\n",
       "language he depicted the condition of these poor, sad, weary\n",
       "sufferers, bearing their heavy burden of sin and sorrow, longing to\n",
       "be rid of it, but knowing not how to throw it off, groaning in secret\n",
       "places, with an abiding dread of what the future might bring to them.\n",
       "He brought tears to many eyes unused to weep, by the vividness with\n",
       "which he portrayed the soul in darkness, but longing fox the light,\n",
       "empty, void of faith in God or man, shut up in a prison of gloomy\n",
       "thought and forebodings, every day verging toward the frightful chasm\n",

       "turning from the weary and heavy laden, he pointed to the One who\n",
       "could deliver them from all their wretchedness, the note of sadness\n",
       "still lingered. Instead of the triumphant ring of victory from the\n",
       "freed soul, the tone of peace and rest from those delivered from\n",
       "their heavy load, there was an unexplained want of harmony between\n",

       "during which they were waiting his reply to their call had deepened\n",
       "their anxiety to obtain the services of one so highly recommended,\n",
       "but a weight had fallen on their spirits, and they silently left the\n",

       "\n",
       "IN the mean time, in the spacious chamber assigned to the clergyman,\n",
       "a terrible conflict was raging. Possessed of the keenest\n",
       "susceptibilities, with a morbid sense of his own unworthiness,\n",
       "he was, alas, too well aware of the impression left upon his hearers\n",
       "by his morning's discourse.\n",
       "\n",

       "O Lord! All my trust is in thee.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "A light tap at his door disturbed his meditations. He presented\n",
       "to Annie a face so pallid and suffering that she started back,\n",

       "\"You are ill, Mr. Angus: let me call mother.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh no! I am not ill,—I mean not much. Certainly, I have a\n",

       "\n",
       "His pallid countenance confirmed Annie's statement of his illness.\n",
       "Mrs. Asbury, with true motherly kindness, ordered a cup of coffee\n",
       "with out milk or sugar, but postponed an examination of the case\n",
       "until a more fitting opportunity.\n",
       "\n",
       "Seated opposite Mr. Angus at the table was fairy little figure,\n",
       "introduced to him as \"Our baby Ethel.\" She had large gray eyes shaded\n",
       "and deepened by long, black lashes. Raising her eyes timidly at\n",
       "first, she glanced at the stranger, gave a little start at the\n",
       "expression which beamed in his face, then her whole countenance—eyes,\n",

       "After dinner, one look of entreaty brought the little miss to the\n",
       "clergyman,—no longer a stranger,—when, to the undisguised\n",
       "astonishment of her parents, she allowed herself to be folded in his\n",
       "arms, her long flaxen curls floating over his breast. Nestling close\n",
       "to his side, with her eyes uplifted to his, she remained, quietly\n",
       "listening to the conversation which followed, rewarded occasionally\n",
       "by a smile so sweet, so full of tender yearning, that not only the\n",
       "child's but the mother's heart was wholly won.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Asbury had asked some questions concerning Mr. Angus's mission\n",

       "\"Marion will like to hear about this: she loves such work.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She is a real missionary herself,\" urged Annie.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Not exactly,\" laughing, \"though she is as near as a daughter. She is\n",
       "the daughter of Mrs. Asbury's cousin, now deceased. Indeed she has\n",
       "lost both her parents, and we have adopted her. She calls us uncle\n",
       "and aunt.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I want Marion to come home quick, pa.\" Then, turning again to look\n",
       "in the face above her, Ethel said, \"I'll let my Marion love you too.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A great piece of condescension on Ethel's part, Mr. Angus,\" added\n",
       "the mother, laughing heartily. \"The little puss is extremely jealous\n",
       "in her affection for Marion, and scarce allows her cousin out of her\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Does your niece not live at home, then?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, no, sir. She teaches music in Madame La Vergnes's Institute\n",

       "her own earnestness, \"you musn't think our Marion naughty or\n",
       "obstinate. It was her duty she said, and so she went.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ethel, I fear you will tire Mr. Angus, sitting in his lap so long.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He pressed her tightly in his arms and waited to hear what she would\n",

       "hand softly on his cheek.\n",
       "\n",
       "He took the small hand in his, held it for a moment, asked, \"At what\n",
       "time does your Sunday school commence?\" put her hand to his lips as\n",
       "he said, rising, \"We are friends from this time, Ethel. Good by for\n",
       "an hour or two,\" and left the room.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I like him ever so much,\" exclaimed Annie. \"Aren't you glad now,\n",

       "\n",
       "Perhaps Mr. Asbury would have answered still more warmly could he\n",

       "went up from a full heart.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is this a ray of light from thy throne, O my heavenly Father? May I\n",
       "not accept it as an answer to prayer for help,—as a token of thy\n",
       "loving care? O God, I bless thee!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Making his way from his chamber, he saw Ethel sitting on the lower\n",
       "stair waiting for him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You may kiss me if you want to,\" she said, putting up her rosy lips.\n",
       "\n",
       "He caught her in his arms, kissed her again, the mother coming\n",
       "forward just in time to hear him say, \"God bless you, precious\n",
       "child!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "How warm his heart felt with this new glow. With his whole soul he\n",
       "received the loving confidence of this little one as a token of\n",
       "divine favor. God had accepted him and would bless his work among\n",
       "these people.\n",
       "\n",
       "Arriving at the chapel, the superintendent of the school came forward\n",
       "to meet him, with the request that, in the place of the usual\n",
       "exercises, he would address them. But Mr. Angus requested to be\n",
       "allowed to watch the workings of the school consenting, however, to\n",
       "talk to them at the end.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is this your usual number?\" he inquired, glancing over the room.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes sir, about the average.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Are they punctual in their attendance,—teachers and scholars?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, sir; that is one great drawback to success.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do these children not go to church? I saw few children there.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, sir; they seldom go.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Declining a seat on the platform, Mr. Angus drew an arm-chair near\n",
       "the Bible class and waited for the superintendent to call the school\n",
       "to order. The gong sounded, but the noise did not decrease. The\n",
       "second time, with the aid of the teachers, the loud whispering\n",
       "abated, when, in a low voice, impossible to be heard at the farther\n",
       "end of the room, the superintendent offered prayer. A hymn was given\n",
       "out, and all looked around for the lady who usually played the\n",
       "melodeon. She was absent, and at last, just as the singing was to be\n",
       "omitted, Annie Asbury came forward blushing, and said, \"I will try\n",
       "to play.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Angus was afflicted with a keen ear for discords. I can only say\n",
       "that during the singing he was agonized. Before the closing exercises\n",
       "he had made up his mind that here at least there was work for the\n",
       "pastor. The apathy was alarming. With few exceptions, the teachers\n",
       "hurried through the lesson, accepting without reproof the too\n",
       "evidently manufactured excuses in place of a well-learned lesson;\n",
       "then shutting the book, he or she became totally oblivious of all\n",
       "that was passing, some even leaving the class to talk with another\n",
       "teacher.\n",
       "\n",
       "That was a face thoroughly in earnest which confronted the school\n",
       "when the superintendent announced that \"Rev. Mr. Angus, our pastor,\n",
       "will address you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "In a full, impressive voice the clergyman began.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Boys and girls,—yes, and teachers too,—we are strangers to-day,\n",
       "but we shall not continue so. I have a good memory for names and\n",
       "faces. I intend to know you all, every one. I have come here to be\n",
       "one of you, to love you, and I hope to be loved in return.\n",
       "My business is to lead every one in this room to the arms of the\n",
       "blessed Saviour, and I ask you all to help me. As many as are\n",
       "willing, I ask to come after school and give me your hand in token\n",
       "of your acceptance of this contract. Until we meet again next\n",
       "Sunday, I ask you to consider seriously a few questions. You can\n",
       "give your answers in writing if you please. I shall like that best;\n",
       "or you may come to me,—not in classes, but individually, and\n",
       "answer them.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"First. What do I come to Sunday school for,—to please God, or to\n",
       "please my parents, or to please myself?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Second. Does my coming just as I have been used to coming please\n",
       "God,—does it please my parents,—does it please me?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Third. If I neither please God, my parents, nor myself, in what way\n",
       "can I change my actions to do so?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Now, with the permission of your superintendent, I will ask you to\n",
       "rise and join me in one verse.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;\n",
       "Praise Him, all creatures here below;\n",
       "Praise Him above, ye heavenly host;\n",
       "Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Remember God is here: let us not mock Him; now begin.\" His voice was\n",
       "a deep, rich baritone, which resounded through the chapel, carrying\n",
       "the scholars and teachers with him. At the close, he stood with his\n",
       "hand extended toward a little girl near him. Boys and girls pressed\n",
       "forward, each one giving his own name, until only the teachers\n",
       "remained. To these, as they gathered around him, he said,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Will it be too much for me to ask that each one of you will ponder\n",
       "the questions I gave you? The work of a Sunday-school teacher may be\n",
       "wearisome and unpleasant, or it may be glorious, most blessed. It is\n",
       "God's own work; and He is a good paymaster.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Annie persuaded her brother to wait for Mr. Angus, but hesitated\n",
       "about joining him when she saw how sad he looked. With a frankness\n",
       "which was her peculiar charm she said, timidly,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We waited to walk home with you, but perhaps you would rather go\n",
       "alone.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Thank you, yes.\" Then, rousing himself, he added, \"You are very\n",
       "kind. I shall be glad of your company.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was true that in the excitement of the past hour his own personal\n",
       "grief had been absorbed in the sorrow he felt at finding the Sunday\n",
       "school in such a low condition. He began to realize that this was the\n",
       "keynote by which he must judge of the spiritual state of the church.\n",
       "Then doubts of his fitness for the work assailed him, and he was\n",
       "appalled with the reflection that it was too late now to recede.\n",
       "It was at this minute that Annie met him. He would have given much\n",
       "to be alone, to fight his battle unobserved; but no, it was better\n",
       "that he should not dwell on such painful, unavailing thoughts.\n",
       "\n",
       "Annie glanced at him occasionally, as with knitted brows he hurried\n",
       "forward, but did not speak until he was about to turn the wrong way.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This is our street, Mr. Angus,\" she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Pardon me, Annie, I am usually quick at finding my way, but—I am\n",
       "thinking about your Sunday school. Were the children more inattentive\n",
       "to-day than usual?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, sir. Marion goes wild about it. She thinks everything in it is\n",
       "horrid. I heard her talking to the superintendent; she told him the\n",
       "mode of teaching, the want of order, the singing, were all as bad as\n",
       "could be; but Marion is a singer, you know.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How long has this gentleman been superintendent?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Only a few weeks. They tried one and another, but nobody would take\n",
       "it. Marion said Mr. Molton only accepted because he was too\n",
       "good-natured to say 'I won't,' as the others did.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "At the close of the evening service the congregation were not a\n",
       "little astonished by the request to remain in their seats for a few\n",
       "minutes after the benediction had been pronounced, nor was the\n",
       "astonishment abated when the young pastor elect began to address\n",
       "them. It was as well for them to know it now as any time. He never\n",
       "made any unnecessary preliminary remarks; he made a fierce dash at\n",
       "any subject and done with it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Every eye was fixed on him when he began.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Owing to my peculiar views as to the dignity of the office of an\n",
       "ambassador of Christ, I declined to come among you as a candidate for\n",
       "your favor. I knew nothing of the state of your church and society. I\n",
       "had no experience to guide me, except that derived from my mission\n",

       "IN one of the main avenues in a large city stands a spacious building\n",

       "would amuse herself so quietly that he almost forgot her presence.\n",
       "During his study hours he often rose from his books and paced the\n",
       "floor while he arranged the topics of his sermons. One glance showed\n",
       "her he was busy, and she scarcely moved. Sometimes he seated himself\n",
       "in a large chair for the same purpose, when the little one,\n",
       "watching every movement, obeyed the motion of his hand, and with\n",
       "her favorite dolly in her arms, silently crept to his lap, sitting so\n",

       "\n",
       "FROM the first Marion had been agreeably impressed with Mr. Angus;\n",
       "though after hearing from Aunt Thankful of his first sermon and his\n",
       "cry for help after the evening service, agreed with her aged friend\n",
       "that he must have known real sorrow; sorrow from the effects of which\n",
       "he could not all at once rally. After hearing his prayers, it seemed\n",
       "to her impossible to believe that his sorrow was caused by any act of\n",
       "his own. If so, she was certain that it had been heartily repented\n",
       "of. The scene so innocently referred to by Ethel took hold of her\n",
       "imagination. In the solitude of his chamber he knelt, his little pet\n",
       "by his side, her hand held fast in his, while tears ran down his\n",
       "cheeks, as he implored forgiveness for past offences. Do what she\n",
       "Would, she could not shake off the memories of this scene.\n",
       "\n",
       "Marion was young in years, only twenty-three her next birthday;\n",
       "but her life had been an eventful one. Blessed with Christian\n",
       "parents, her opening mind eagerly imbibed the practical truths of\n",
       "the Bible. Jesus Christ was embraced as her Saviour from sin in this\n",
       "life, and from the punishment of sin in the life to come. God was\n",
       "to her a tender, loving Father, to whom she might go at any hour,\n",
       "with the same freedom as she approached her earthly father.\n",
       "She realized in an unusual manner His watchful providence, guiding\n",
       "and guarding her at every step of her young life. When at the age of\n",
       "seventeen she was bereft of both her earthly parents, she accepted\n",
       "in all their fulness the promises of God to the fatherless ones,\n",
       "and never had these gracious promises failed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her education being incomplete, her guardian' sent her to New York\n",
       "City to the care of her father's sister, an amiable but thoroughly\n",
       "worldly woman. Mrs. Williamson considered her duty accomplished when\n",
       "she had seen her niece arrayed in the most becoming mourning attire,\n",
       "had entered her at a fashionable institution, and introduced her to\n",
       "her own select circle.\n",
       "\n",
       "But these surroundings, so unlike the quiet refinement of her own\n",
       "sweet home, instead of weaning the young orphan from the pure\n",
       "pleasures of a Christian life, left her with such a yearning for the\n",
       "society of those who sympathized in her dearest joys that she\n",
       "resolved to spend more time than ever in communion with her Saviour.\n",
       "Happy indeed are those who, losing Christian companionship,\n",
       "are driven for comfort to Christ himself. His love can so fill\n",
       "the soul thus depending on Him as to compensate for the loss\n",
       "of every earthly solace.\n",
       "\n",
       "Marion was allowed to choose her own church, and at once joined\n",

       "followed.\n",

       "of unusual ability.\n",
       "\n",
       "Music was, however, her specialty. It was passion with her, and even\n",

       "\n",
       "\"How plainly I can see a Father's hand leading me all the way\n",
       "through!\" she used to say. \"He gave me the ability to sing, and when\n",

       "the comfort of others.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She alluded to the fact of being invited by a gentleman connected\n",
       "with her Sunday school to sing for the patients at the \"Home for the\n",

       "the words of cheer, it was an impulse I could scarcely resist to fall\n",
       "on my knees and thank her for letting me sing for her. 'You have\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh!\" exclaimed Marion, clasping her hands to her breast as she\n",
       "recalled the scene. \"Who am I, that I should be so blessed?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "During the summer months Mr. Williamson usually travelled with his\n",

       "oldest daughter, about whom so many hopes had clustered, the light of\n",
       "the home, the pride of parents and friends, had received a summons to\n",
       "leave all that had hitherto been so dear and enter on the unknown,—\n",
       "the infinite. Shuddering with fear, she turned to her parents for\n",
       "help, but they could only weep and wring their hands. At length their\n",
       "clergyman was summoned, and from this hour his visits were frequent.\n",
       "The knitted brow had given way to a calm seriousness, as with\n",
       "trembling lips she said, \"I do believe Christ is my Saviour, and that\n",
       "He will lead me safely home.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Her parents, too, if not really submissive, were trying to say,\n",
       "\"Thy will be done.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The coming of Marion at such a crisis was indeed a blessing. Her very\n",
       "first words as she sat down by the bedside, after offering and\n",
       "receiving a loving embrace, lit up the face of the dying girl with\n",
       "a ray of Heaven's own light.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"O Helen, how I wish I could change places with you! Going home\n",
       "to Christ, to be with Him forever, to see the dear saints who have\n",
       "gone before, to talk to them of what Jesus has done for you, to sing\n",
       "with them the new song, 'Worthy the Lamb,' to sit down by the beloved\n",
       "John, to see Peter and hear him repeat the story of his grief at the\n",
       "denial of his Lord, to talk with Moses and Joseph and Samuel,\n",
       "to think that you will be forever free from the struggles with sin,\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Tears were streaming down Mrs. Asbury's cheeks, but wholly\n",

       "in his household. Every day rendered it more certain that a grim\n",
       "messenger was hovering about, waiting for an opportunity to enter,\n",
       "but his approach was no longer dreaded. The chamber where the patient\n",
       "sufferer lay seemed the brightest in the house. Marion, who had\n",
       "constituted herself chief nurse, went in and came out with a smile.\n",
       "Her voice was often heard singing there, not sad, pensive strains,\n",
       "but notes with a ring of triumph. The names of our blessed Lord,\n",
       "Jesus, Immanuel, Saviour, were constantly repeated, and dwelt on\n",
       "lovingly. The very words seemed to give strength, even in the\n",
       "lingering echoes.\n",
       "\n",
       "On one occasion, Mr. Asbury, too anxious to remain long absent from\n",
       "the house, quietly entered the chamber just as Marion began\n",
       "a familiar hymn. He had often heard it before, but never with such\n",
       "a thrill as now. Even the dying girl was joining in the singing.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How sweet the name of Jesus sounds\n",
       "In a believer's ear,\n",
       "It soothes his sorrows, heals his wounds,\n",
       "And drives away his fear.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It makes the wounded spirit whole,\n",

       "last lines was answered. The soul was refreshed, invigorated, and\n",

       "while Marion in a clear voice repeated the inspired words, \"'Though I\n",

       "well, and I have too great a work in it to put myself in danger.\n",
       "Besides, I have the earnest approval of dear Helen. I talked with her\n",

       "fanatic, who, if permitted, would convert their house into an asylum\n",
       "for paupers, coolly turned her back upon her, entirely ignoring her\n",

       "can I so readily gain an influence over them. If I can win only one\n",
       "of them to higher aims in life, will it not be worth the effort?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Even Mrs. Asbury expostulated with her niece. \"You are free,\"\n",
       "she urged, \"to go into any society you please, and you surely can\n",
       "find young ladies quite as much in need of good influences as those\n",
       "connected with Madame La Vergne's school. You will, when too late,\n",
       "perhaps, find it very irksome to be confined to certain hours.\"\n",

       "busy one. Often, when she retired to rest, both body and brain were\n",
       "weary, and yet she was very happy. In her own home she tended her\n",
       "flowers and fed her birds with a song on her lips. She met her\n",
       "friends with a smile so sweet, joyous, and free from care that they\n",
       "envied her. Naturally, she was overflowing with fun; indeed, her\n",
       "vivacity, her quickness at repartee, made her the life of any circle,\n",
       "and her company, while she resided with her uncle, was sought by the\n",
       "young of both sexes.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was not her intention to exclude herself wholly from society,\n",

       "She was surrounded by a group of young people to whom she was\n",
       "relating a story, the arch expression on her face bringing into play\n",
       "all her dimples. Gradually one and another, some advanced in life,\n",
       "drew nearer, eager to share in the enjoyment. Perceiving this, Marion\n",

       "and no gossip. Pshaw! Fact, no talk about religion either. A strange\n",
       "fanatic that.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Stranger still, perhaps, that the old man persistently lingered in\n",
       "the neighborhood of Miss Howard, leaning forward to catch every word,\n",
       "drinking in the musical ripple of laughter, which Marion's friends\n",
       "used to call one of her greatest charms, watching the pure, fresh\n",
       "countenance, the merry, earnest eyes, until the ice about his heart\n",
       "began to thaw. When they parted, to no one's surprise more than to\n",
       "his own, he extended his hand, and gave hers a warm pressure as he\n",
       "said,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am glad that I have met one who has no trouble.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am an orphan,\" responded Marion, tears suddenly dimming her eyes,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"You do love life then, even though your parents have left you.\"\n",

       "There was a touch of sarcasm in his voice which made her pity him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, yes; I am very happy to be alive. There is so much to be done.\n",
       "I envy nothing so much as the leisure hours some do not know what\n",
       "to do with. Yes, it is good to live.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What can you find to employ other people's leisure beside your own?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She gave one quick, earnest glance into his face, paused a moment,\n",

       "\"I try to make others happy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She was turning away when he caught her hand, and with a strange\n",
       "twitching around his mouth, said,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You seem to be in earnest. I, who doubt every one, find it hard to\n",
       "doubt you. If you mean that you try to help the poor, you will find\n",
       "it a thankless task. It doesn't pay.\" There was intense bitterness in\n",
       "his tone.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But, my dear sir, that is because you go to the wrong paymaster.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Poor man! Doubting every one, endured only for the sake of your\n",
       "money; how I pity you,\" was Marion's reflection, as she drove swiftly\n",

       "GAMES AND ENTERTAINMENTS.\n",
       "\n",
       "ALL this had occurred long before our first introduction to the\n",
       "young lady. She still continued to give lessons in music at Madame\n",
       "La Vergne's school, but received no compensation except in the case\n",
       "of three wealthy pupils. The amount received from these three just\n",
       "defrayed the expense for tuition, etc., for two misses she was\n",
       "educating. One of these, Annie Leman, gave promise of great\n",
       "proficiency in music.\n",
       "\n",
       "Marion had speedy occasion to remember her resolution with regard to\n",
       "Mr. Lambert. She was making some visits in a street crowded with\n",
       "tenement houses, and had for the moment become separated from Hepsey.\n",
       "With a basket on her arm she was trying to make her way up a crazy\n",
       "flight of stairs when she heard a quick step behind her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have caused me a pretty race,\" shouted a man's voice, which she\n",
       "instantly recalled as belonging to her irascible friend. \"Good for\n",
       "heart complaint, very!\" putting his hand upon his breast and\n",
       "breathing quickly. Possessing himself of her basket, he lifted the\n",
       "cover, and said with a sneer, \"Just as I supposed; tea and sugared\n",
       "dainties—ought to be arrested—idiotic—pests to society—humbug\n",
       "—sentiment and nonsense!\" He was muttering away, when he caught her\n",
       "look of pity, which rendered him furious.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How dare you come here?\" he shouted. \"You, who claim to belong to\n",
       "decent society. You, a chit of a girl, alone and unprotected in such\n",
       "a region of filth and pollution.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Marion's cheeks flushed with anger, and she was going to retort in a\n",
       "like strain, but something in his appearance checked her.\n",
       "\n",
       "He looked so thin and wan and friendless. Suddenly the anger faded\n",
       "away and with a smile she held out her hand for the basket, saying\n",
       "playfully,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If you had waited a minute, you would have seen that I am not alone\n",
       "here; and I have good company while you are near to protect me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nonsense!\" His mouth twitched and she was sure his eyes twinkled at\n",
       "this unexpected retort. When finding herself mistress of the\n",
       "situation, she asked,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How dare you come here? It is very dangerous,\" pointing to the\n",
       "staircase, which Hepsey at this moment was trying to climb.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Saw you—thought you—danger—better send police—not fit for\n",
       "one of your sex.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He turned off into one of the filthy rooms, and they heard him\n",
       "scolding the inmates as though he enjoyed it.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What a brute!\" muttered Hepsey; but Marion Only laughed, adding,\n",
       "\"I'm not a bit afraid of him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "As they were leaving the court he came up out of a cellar and joined\n",
       "them.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Delightful vicinity; very healthy, too!\" pointing to a stagnant pool\n",
       "of filth in which a pig was wallowing. He shrugged his shoulders,\n",
       "chuckling with mirth.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I see you enjoy it as much as we do, Mr. Lambert. It's so good for\n",
       "the spirits to see people enjoying themselves.\" A group of boys were\n",
       "playing marbles on the uneven pavement, and scarcely moved for them\n",
       "to pass.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Get out of the path,\" he shouted, striking his cane right and left.\n",
       "\"Don't you see you're in the way of your betters?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, Mr. Lambert!\" exclaimed Marion, \"you have hurt that boy,\" as one\n",
       "of the lads put his hand to his head, sending after them a terrible\n",
       "oath.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Pshaw! they're not tender—good for them—business to get out of\n",
       "the way.\" But when they were about to turn out of the street and\n",
       "parted company, they saw him hurrying back to the group, shaking his\n",
       "cane and shouting, \"Wait! Wait!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Curious to know what he would do, Marion went back to the head of the\n",
       "street, and saw the eccentric old man throw a handful of coins to the\n",
       "boys, as he could not get them to wait for another beating.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What a disappointed life he must have had,\" she said to Hepsey,\n",
       "after walking in silence for some minutes. \"I wonder whether he has\n",
       "any heart left.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not likely, miss,\" was the brief reply.\n",
       "\n",
       "A few weeks later Marion was having quite a jubilee in her parlors.\n",
       "She had invited all the older classes in the mission school, and was\n",
       "entertaining them with a play called \"Shadows.\" At the end of the\n",
       "back parlor was a wide door across which a white curtain was\n",
       "stretched, and the children sitting in the darkened rooms saw behind\n",
       "the curtain scenes which made them open both eyes and mouth\n",
       "in astonishment. A man was sitting in a chair in a doctor's office\n",
       "and the physician was examining him. First the outside of his head,\n",
       "then the inside, taking out with pincers, one tooth after another and\n",
       "putting them in again, taking from the patient's throat tumblers,\n",
       "plates, long-handled kitchen spoons, a hammer, and at last an\n",
       "umbrella, which had to be pulled and jerked, till the patient\n",
       "shrieked.\n",
       "\n",
       "They were in the midst of all this when Marion heard a familiar voice\n",
       "muttering,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Fool's play,—miserable waste—time,—money,—better send them to\n",
       "the penitentiary at once.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Since their late interview Marion had thought much of the strange,\n",
       "lonely old man, and had nearly made up her mind that he only tried to\n",
       "disguise his real feelings by his outlandish manner.  She gave him\n",
       "her hand cordially, as she said,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I did not invite you to my party, Mr. Lambert, but I am very glad\n",
       "you came. I was just needing some help.  My doctor in there needs a\n",
       "new patient: come, I will introduce you to him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Patient, eh! Well, I need a doctor badly enough. What do you want me\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Only to have your head cut off, sir.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Hem! modest request,—very civil, must say. My head is as 'valuable\n",
       "to me as—yours, for instance.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But he followed her to the hall, from which they could pass to the\n",
       "room in the rear.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Your head will be restored in as good a condition as it is now,\" she\n",
       "explained, with an arch smile.\n",
       "\n",
       "Presently the children saw the old gentleman take his seat in the\n",
       "chair, his long beard distinctly visible through the curtain.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What do you complain of?\" they heard the doctor ask.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Liver!\" shouted the patient. \"Haven't slept a wink for ten years.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not liver, but conscience,—diseased conscience.\" This was Miss\n",
       "Howard's voice. \"It needs reorganizing, sir. It affects the whole\n",
       "body, sir. I shall begin with the head and cut away all the diseased\n",
       "part until we come to soundness, sir.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is this the way you treat your patients? I'll not stand it. Cut off\n",
       "my head, indeed!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Absolute necessity, sir. If you wish to be cured, there must be no\n",
       "delay.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Pretty sight for the public,—man minus head.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My salve, sir, my famous Royal Recuperative Salve, known throughout\n",
       "the world, sir, will make your head grow again in a few hours, sir.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Don't believe a word of such humbug; but cut away; something must be\n",
       "done.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The spectators held their breath as they saw the knife cut deep into\n",
       "the flesh, then heard the saw cracking the bone, and, presently,\n",
       "after a terrible groan, the head was severed from the body and thrown\n",
       "to the floor.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Just in time, sir,\" exclaimed the doctor, cheerfully.  \"Disease\n",
       "checked in time; heart and lungs, and liver too, all right. Now for\n",
       "the salve!\"  They saw him rub the neck thoroughly with ointment from\n",
       "a box, and then the patient was carefully moved from the chair.\n",
       "\n",
       "The children remained in their seats awestruck, but the gas was relit\n",
       "and Miss Howard came into the parlor looking particularly smiling.\n",
       "Wonder of wonders. It was scarcely fifteen minutes before the patient\n",
       "appeared, leaning on the arm of the doctor, his head erect and firm\n",
       "as ever.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miraculous cure,\" he muttered. \"Yes, I'll write an account for your\n",
       "advertising paper. Head all right; little tenderness here, that's\n",
       "all,\" pointing to his throat.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then,\" said Dr. James, laughing heartily, as he took off his false\n",
       "mustache, \"I will bid you good day, sir, and wish you joy of your new\n",
       "head.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Lambert threw himself into a chair and went off into convulsions\n",
       "of laughter.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Outdoes the theatre by all odds. Hurrah for the Royal Recuperative\n",
       "Salve to cure diseased consciences! I'll take twenty bottles!\n",
       "Hurrah!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "In the mean time Marion took the children behind the curtain and\n",
       "explained to them the method by which these wonders were\n",
       "accomplished. She recalled James, to show them that he only passed\n",
       "his hand down by the side of the throat, when Hepsey, concealed from\n",
       "view, passed to him tumblers, umbrella, etc., all of which, in the\n",
       "shadow, seemed to come from the throat.\n",
       "\n",
       "The decapitated head was made of pasteboard, cut to resemble an old\n",
       "man with a beard.\n",
       "\n",
       "The apartments occupied by Marion were situated in a fashionable part\n",
       "of the city. Wishing to be entirely independent, and yet desirous of\n",
       "avoiding the publicity of a hotel, she had persuaded Mr. and Mrs.\n",
       "Mitchell, friends of her parents, to hire this house next to a hotel\n",
       "and allow her the entire use of the second floor. Her meals being\n",
       "sent in from the table d'hôte, she could indulge her hospitality\n",
       "without burdening her friends, who were advanced in age. Besides\n",
       "Hepsey, she had a boy of sixteen years, whom she employed in various\n",
       "ways, accompanying her in stormy weather in her visits to the poor,\n",
       "going errands, etc. This boy, Jim, or, as she called him, James\n",
       "Kelly, was one of the first-fruits of her mission work, and, being\n",
       "an orphan like herself, she was deeply interested in his welfare.\n",
       "\n",
       "At the death of her parents, their home in the country was rented,\n",
       "the furniture, with the exception of certain costly articles,\n",
       "pictures, etc., being allowed to remain in the house. These had been\n",
       "brought to the city, and now beautified her pleasant home. Marion had\n",
       "a passion for flowers, and at her own expense had built out from her\n",
       "parlor a small conservatory, which was filled with her favorite\n",
       "plants. One seldom saw her without a bud of some kind doing service\n",
       "for a brooch at her throat; and in her calls upon the sick, a few\n",
       "fresh-cut violets or a sweet rose-bud proved a great help in gaining\n",
       "the confidence she so earnestly sought.\n",
       "\n",
       "Believing, as she did, that our social qualities were given us to be\n",
       "cultivated, our young friend gave frequent entertainments, always\n",
       "supported by the presence of Mr. and Mrs. Mitchell. To further her\n",
       "own plans she selected games, encouraged charades, improvised\n",
       "characters, occasionally taking part herself, on which occasions\n",
       "she abandoned herself to the enjoyment with the freshness of a child.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I believe,\" she responded to a Christian friend, who was taking her\n",
       "to task for encouraging a taste for the theatrical,—\"I believe that\n",
       "I have done more good by my charades than I could have hoped for in\n",
       "any other way. In one instance I have in mind, at a critical period\n",
       "for a young favorite, I persuaded her to come to a charade I got up\n",
       "especially for her; and I am satisfied the result was happy. She was\n",
       "in danger of giving way to evil influences; her conscience troubled\n",
       "her; she became very irritable. I had a little talk with her, took\n",
       "her with me to visit a poor family, who were indeed rich in faith,\n",
       "and then invited her to my entertainment. She came to me the second\n",
       "day after and, with a burst of joyful tears, threw herself into my\n",
       "arms, exclaiming,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"'I'm so happy: the struggle is over.  Oh, I can never tell you how I\n",
       "thank you!' She had given up the acquaintance of one who was leading\n",
       "her astray, who would have made her a wretched husband, who had\n",
       "denounced Christians as gloomy fanatics, who considered laughing a\n",
       "sin, etc. My party, mirthful and gay as it was, commended itself to\n",
       "her conscience; even the play itself conveyed to her excited mind a\n",
       "high moral sentiment, as I had intended. She went home, passed the\n",
       "night pacing the floor, while she asked help of God to decide aright.\n",
       "She is now an earnest, cheerful, Christian worker. Unsolicited, she\n",
       "left the fashionable church which she had been attending, and is my\n",
       "powerful alto singer at our mission.\"\n",

       "ON Ethel's fifth birthday she claimed the promise of her mother,—\n",
       "that she should sit up to family prayers. Except on Sunday night,\n",
       "when supper was served at an earlier hour than on other days, it was\n",
       "her habit to eat her simple meal of bread and milk and be in bed\n",
       "before the ringing of the supper-bell.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sitting up for prayers was quite an era in her young life. No sooner\n",
       "was the meal concluded than she brought her low chair and placed it\n",
       "close to Mr. Angus. It was the custom to sing a hymn before reading\n",
       "the Scriptures, and the pastor held the book so that Ethel could look\n",
       "on the page with him. As he named the hymn he merely remarked, \"It is\n",
       "pleasant to have all join in this social worship.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The child, considering herself included in this invitation, as indeed\n",
       "she was, began in a low timid tone to sing her own little hymn, but\n",
       "presently, becoming used to the sound of her voice, sang so loud as\n",
       "almost to drown the tones of the piano, upon which Annie was playing.\n",
       "Over and over again she repeated the words, \"Jesus, come and make me\n",
       "good, good, Jesus come and make me good.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The tune as well as the words were improvised for the occasion, and\n",
       "did not in the least chord with the notes they were singing. Most of\n",
       "those present smiled, Gardner tittered behind his book and about\n",
       "Mr. Angus's mouth a suspicious twitching was noticed, but no one\n",
       "interfered with the child's evident enjoyment of the occasion.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I'm quite sure,\" remarked Mr. Angus afterward, as he seated Ethel\n",
       "on his knee, \"that Jesus will hear and answer your prayer. Would you\n",
       "like to learn a hymn to sing with us? Ask your sister to teach you\n",
       "one, and you can learn the tune also. You have a very good voice.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A powerful one, certainly,\" added her father, laughing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Angus early formed the acquaintance of Mary Falkner, the crippled\n",
       "girl. As Marion had told him, she was truly happy, though at times a\n",
       "great sufferer. In every event of her life she recognized a Father's\n",
       "loving, protecting hand, and was so truly thankful for every favor\n",
       "received that it was a privilege to bestow kindness.\n",
       "\n",
       "On one occasion, when the pastor was sitting by her bedside,\n",
       "realizing, as afterward he insisted, that he was receiving rather\n",
       "than giving consolation, the door softly opened and Marion,\n",
       "unannounced, walked in. Perceiving the visitor, she was retiring when\n",
       "Mr. Angus rose to leave.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Don't go, please,\" Mary said to Marion, \"I was just intending to ask\n",

       "\"I was sure,\" answered Marion, in a hearty voice, \"that he would be a\n",
       "comfort to you. You like him so much, I have a great mind to ask you\n",
       "a question. Have you ever noticed any peculiarity in his prayers or\n",
       "in his manner?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Tears gushed to Mary's eyes which no physical suffering could have\n",
       "forced from them, and, clasping her hands, she exclaimed, \"Oh, how I\n",
       "wish I could comfort him! And he says I have. He has a deep, abiding\n",
       "sorrow. It is living sorrow, too. It cannot be grief for the dead.\n",
       "Once he quite forgot that I was present, and he prayed; but it is too\n",
       "sacred to repeat. Oh, how my heart ached for him!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mary covered her face and wept.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I wish he would unburden his heart to you, Mary. I'm sure you could\n",
       "comfort him. He is a puzzle to me. There is a weight on his spirits.\n",
       "I have seen an expression of agony come over his face when he thought\n",
       "himself unobserved. Well, we can pray God to appear for him. I have\n",
       "never spoken of him in this way before.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Grief is too sacred to meddle with, at least such grief as his,\n",
       "Marion. I have told my Saviour about it.\"\n",

       "When the young lady left the humble roof she repaired to the station\n",
       "near by to get her satchel, and found Mr. Angus just sending a\n",
       "telegram to the city. He advanced eagerly to meet her, holding out\n",
       "his hand.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are the very one to advise me,\" he said, his whole face beaming.\n",
       "\"I am a poor physician, but I know something of medicine. I have\n",
       "learned about Mary's case, and I do not feel hopeless of her\n",
       "recovery. You live in the city of New York, and have probably heard\n",
       "of the Home for the Sick.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Certainly I have. I often go there to visit my sick friends.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then you will agree with me that, if I can procure a place for her\n",
       "in that Christian home, she will have a fair chance for recovery.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Strange I never thought of it before,\" murmured Marion, as though\n",
       "speaking to herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not at all strange. It did not occur to me till this morning, and I\n",
       "have just written a message to Dr. B-, the superintendent, asking to\n",
       "have a surgeon sent to examine the case. I have myself been an inmate\n",
       "of the Home, and have the most entire confidence in the care and\n",
       "skill she would receive.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Will they send so far, Mr. Angus? I mean, will there not be great\n",
       "expense? Excuse me, but I would advise another plan. Mary is a great\n",
       "favorite of mine; indeed, I am under obligations to her. There is an\n",
       "eminent surgeon in the next town, whom I will take to see her this\n",
       "very day. If he gives us hope, I will go to the hospital at once on\n",
       "my return to the city. I only wish I had thought of it years ago.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "A curious expression on Mr. Angus's face startled Marion, with a\n",
       "slight shrug of the shoulders, which was strangely familiar to her.\n",
       "It was as though he had said,—\"You are taking the matter out of my\n",
       "hands with a vengeance.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Marion laughed aloud. \"Don't think me officious in meddling with your\n",
       "plan,\" she urged. \"I'm a teacher, you know, and accustomed to give\n",
       "orders.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I shall at least claim the pleasure, Miss Howard, of bearing the\n",
       "expense necessary for placing her in the Home.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I'll see about that.\" Marion gave one of those arch glances which\n",
       "brought her dimples into full play. When she smiled, it was like a\n",
       "child's face, pure and fresh, and sweet and loving. For one moment,\n",
       "as he gazed, Mr. Angus forgot his burden. There might yet be\n",
       "something bright for him in life. With a deep sigh he shouldered his\n",
       "burden again, and this time it seemed weightier than ever before.\n",
       "\n",
       "They walked in silence for a time, the young lady puzzling herself\n",
       "to account for the strange associations connected with that peculiar\n",
       "expression on Mr. Angus's face which had so startled her. Somehow it\n",
       "was connected with the Home for the Sick. Rousing herself, and\n",
       "forgetting that his thoughts had not followed hers, she asked,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is it long since you were an inmate?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do you mean of the hospital?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is five years this very month.  It was there I was healed not\n",
       "only in the body, but the soul. Never did any poor mortal need a\n",
       "divine physician more than I did. Words cannot express my gratitude\n",
       "that a merciful Father directed me to that spot. The faithful\n",
       "chaplain found me weighed to the ground, and persuaded me to allow an\n",
       "Almighty Arm to be placed beneath me. Pardon me,\" he added, suddenly\n",
       "interrupting himself, \"I did not remember that to a stranger this\n",
       "must be a wearisome story. I am not used to forget myself in this\n",
       "way.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He turned toward her a face drawn with pain, to meet eyes full of\n",
       "sympathy, and when she murmured softly the words, \"I am not a\n",
       "stranger, I am a friend,\" his feelings almost overcame him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Thank you,\" he said, extending his hand, but instantly withdrawing\n",
       "it; then, controlling himself by a visible effort, went on, \"I found\n",
       "my Saviour within those blessed walls, and was encouraged both by the\n",
       "pastor and chaplain to hope that, by consecrating my life to the\n",
       "service of my divine Master, I might be useful to some poor soul as\n",
       "burdened as myself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Has not that hope been fulfilled, Mr. Angus? Has not Jesus Christ\n",
       "kept his gracious promise to you and given you rest? Pardon me, I am\n",
       "a missionary too. I have thought much of you, and prayed for you, as\n",
       "I do for all my friends. I have feared that—that you have not cast\n",
       "all your burden upon Him. You are trying to bear part of it alone.\n",
       "Sorrow or sin He has atoned for and has promised to take. Oh, do give\n",
       "it all up to Him! For your own sake, for the sake of those in your\n",
       "charge, I entreat you, try His love in all its fulness. It cannot,\n",
       "will not, fail you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Her voice trembled in her eagerness. Suddenly catching a glimpse of\n",
       "his pallid countenance, she stopped short in her walk.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You will forgive, you will understand me,\" she pleaded. \"I for a\n",
       "moment forgot that I am too young to advise you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Howard, even you will turn from me in despair when I ask,\n",

       "clean? Even you have seen the mark of Cain on my brow.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Startled as she was, Marion realized that in order to give comfort to\n",
       "this burdened soul, she must control herself. With a face blanched,\n",
       "and shaking voice, she repeated the gracious promise,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"'Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.' Such a promise\n",
       "holds good, even to the shedder of blood.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do not understand,\" he exclaimed, in great excitement, \"that it was\n",
       "prompted by malice. It was an accident. I—But the scene is too\n",
       "ghastly to recall. To no mortal have I ever breathed the words\n",
       "before. Into the ears of a merciful God I pour my complaint day and\n",
       "night.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Into Marion's eyes came a strange light. The color surged back into\n",
       "her face. Memories of the past, forgotten for years, came rushing\n",
       "over her. She was wholly unaware that she had stopped again, that her\n",
       "eyes were fixed on his, that she was trying to read his very\n",
       "thoughts. It required a great effort to come back to present\n",
       "realities. \"I must say something,\" was her reflection. \"Oh, that I\n",
       "was sure! God grant I may be!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Angus,\" she began, her face beaming with a strange expression of\n",
       "hope and tenderness, \"forgive me for saying it, you have grown\n",
       "morbid, brooding over your past. With all my heart I thank you for\n",
       "your confidence, which I consider as sacred as the grave. Let me say\n",
       "that I look forward confidently to the hour when the sorrow which has\n",
       "weighed you down to the dust will be driven away like the morning\n",

       "\n",
       "ON going to dinner, Marion was not much surprised to hear that the\n",
       "pastor had requested to be excused from the table on the plea of a\n",
       "headache. Mrs. Asbury was preparing tea and toast, which the servant\n",
       "stood waiting to take up on a tray. At this moment Ethel came running\n",
       "up, her face flushed, exclaiming,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mamma, may I stay with Mr. Angus? He is sitting in the chair with\n",
       "his eyes shut, and he looks real sick.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I'll carry the tray myself,\" said Mrs. Asbury, glancing at her\n",
       "husband. \"No, Ethel, stay here till I come back.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He is worse than usual,\" she explained presently, as she brought\n",
       "back the food untouched. \"Ethel, dear, as soon as you have eaten,\n",
       "you may go to him. Strange what an influence she has,\"—turning to\n",
       "the family. \"He asked it as a favor, if I could spare her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. and Mrs. Asbury were so occupied with anxiety about Mr. Angus,\n",
       "whose strength seemed always on the point of giving way, that they\n",
       "did not notice Marion's abstraction. As they were rising from the\n",
       "silent meal, she asked,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Can I have the horse and buggy, uncle? I want to drive to N—. I am\n",
       "going for Dr. Moore to see Mary Falkner.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why not ask him to make a professional call on Mr. Angus?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You might propose it to him, but I doubt whether he would require a\n",
       "surgeon.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That's so; but I mean to have a serious talk with him as soon as he\n",
       "recovers from this attack. It is wicked for him to neglect these\n",
       "warnings.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Annie eagerly offered to accompany Marion to N—; but she only desired\n",
       "to be alone to have time to recall fleeting memories, to reconcile\n",
       "coincidences, and decide how it was best for her to make her surmises\n",
       "known to Mr. Angus.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had driven slowly over the four miles to N— before her final\n",
       "decision was reached. It would be cruel to hold out hopes which might\n",
       "prove fallacious. \"No, I must go home, to make sure. Then, if it be\n",
       "as I hope and believe what a joy.\" Marion stopped, wholly unable to\n",
       "express in words the deep emotions which agitated her. All the time\n",
       "she was tying her horse to the post, she was saying to herself,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Did she mean murder? An accident is not murder.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was with a real effort that she roused herself to tell the\n",
       "physician her errand.  He had just returned from a long drive to\n",
       "visit a patient, and told her he would accompany her at once after\n",
       "eating his dinner, and return in the cars.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the way Marion related all that she knew of Mary's case, and then\n",
       "described the arrangements at the Home for the Sick.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her enthusiasm made him laugh. \"I know all about that,\" he explained.\n",
       "\"I was one of the staff of house surgeons there at one time, and I\n",
       "can say it is truly a home. Very few, even of the wealthiest, can\n",
       "command the care and skill which falls to the lot of the poorest\n",
       "patient there. I remember a wealthy lady coming with a valuable\n",
       "servant who had fractured her arm. When the patient was comfortably\n",
       "placed in bed she was leaving the room, when she met Dr. B-, the\n",
       "pastor and superintendent.\n",

       "\"'I want to recommend to your special attention the woman I have just\n",

       "\"'Certainly, madam,' was his polite answer as he passed into the\n",
       "ward, 'certainly; all our patients have special attention. She shall\n",
       "be well cared for.'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have taken many patients there,\" rejoined Marion, her eye kindling\n",
       "with pleasure. \"I should say that if there were any favorites, they\n",
       "are the very sickest and poorest, and sometimes the most repulsive.\n",
       "But after all, the care of their bodies is only one part. They are\n",
       "led to think of the end of life, and in their enforced seclusion,\n",
       "with the most loving influences about them, they often, very often,\n",
       "come to better thoughts of their Maker, and go out with new hopes and\n",
       "new resolutions in regard to life.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Dr. Moore was introduced to the patient by Marion, who only said that\n",
       "he had called as her friend, to find out whether she could be\n",
       "relieved by treatment from her spasms of pain. He made a careful\n",
       "diagnosis of her case, after which he gave her some powders for\n",
       "temporary relief, bade her take courage, and returned to Marion,\n",
       "who was waiting in the buggy.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have been to the station, Doctor,\" she explained \"and there is no\n",

       "your face that you have good news for me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nonsense! A doctor's face goes for nothing. He has to train it to\n",

       "\n",
       "\"You can't deceive me, Doctor. I know you are going to say she can be\n",
       "relieved.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I will say more. She will always be lame, one limb being shorter\n",
       "than the other, but, with the help of a thick sole to her shoe,\n",
       "I don't see why she should not walk about with as little difficulty\n",
       "as you and I do.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Marion gave a cry of joy, clasping her hands. \"O Doctor!\" she\n",
       "exclaimed, \"what a blessed profession yours is! If I were a man\n",
       "I would be a physician before any other calling. I do thank you\n",
       "so much. How soon may I take her to New York?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I've been thinking,\" he said, gayly, \"of indulging myself with a\n",

       "a bed for her, and leave me to take her there?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Will you, Doctor?\" She gave him a glance brimful, overflowing with\n",
       "delight, and he answered,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, I will do all that. I shall be glad of the opportunity to see\n",
       "the Home once more. Now Marion, I have earned a right to ask you a\n",
       "question. Why don't you get married?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Marion threw back her head and laughed heartily. \"Your question is so\n",
       "entirely unexpected, Doctor, that I shall have to think before I\n",
       "answer. Well, first, I am too busy to go about the country and select\n",
       "the right man. Second, I have formed such an elevated idea of the\n",
       "being whom I would be willing to see in that relation, that in case\n",
       "I had leisure I should be appalled at the difficulties in my path.\n",
       "Thirdly, I am just as happy now as I can be. I have my good old\n",
       "Hepsey and James Kelly, and all my poor people to take care of now.\n",
       "I'm sure I can't imagine what I should do, even with my ideal man.\"\n",
       "The laugh which followed was heart whole.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nevertheless,\" urged Dr. Moore, \"describe this ideal man to me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"His image is scarcely distinct enough for that. First of all, he\n",
       "must be a man who loves God and his neighbor as himself, as our\n",
       "Saviour has commanded.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Humph! I don't know him, but go on.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He must be both strong and tender, firm and gentle, courageous,\n",
       "kind, and courteous, capable of sympathy both in joy and grief.\n",
       "He must be humble in his opinion of himself.\"  Here a sudden\n",
       "reflection checked her, and she added, softly, \"Not too humble,\" then\n",
       "came to an abrupt pause.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Appearance and manners,\" suggested the doctor, without glancing\n",
       "at her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Poor or rich is of no consequence; but he must have ability.\n",
       "Whatever his calling is, he must excel in it.\"\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Like an athlete.\" Suddenly catching a twinkle in her companion's\n",
       "eye, Marion's cheeks and brow became suffused, and she burst out,\n",
       "\"How ridiculous I have made myself! I never thought so much of my\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I'm well acquainted with him,\" said the doctor, demurely. \"He's all\n",

       "asking permission to use the buggy at an early hour to go to a\n",
       "distant part of the town. Seeing her, he explained that, as she had\n",

       "long enough to dash off a letter to Dr. Moore, enclosing the one from\n",
       "the superintendent, and then went to Mrs. Mitchell for advice about a\n",
       "boarding-place. Four or five were advertised as desirable situations;\n",
       "and Marion, putting by her anxiety to begin her search for the\n",
       "package, hurried off in the carriage to examine for herself. Two or\n",

       "between life and death going on in that chamber. She was never seen\n",
       "to sleep, and yet she never seemed weary. Not a movement of that\n",

       "\n",

       "THE third week of Marion's sickness there came a crisis and hope.\n",
       "Yes, it was evident to all there was hope now, where fear had\n",
       "prevailed. The doctor's mouth, which had been so firm and rigid,\n",
       "relaxed; and there was a suspicion of a smile.  Hepsey's eyes were\n",
       "less watery, James opened and shut the outer door in a jubilant\n",

       "\n",
       "\"The doctor begins to hope.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "On Annie Leman's pale face had come beams of light, which made her\n",
       "beautiful. Scarcely conscious of her own action, she went forward\n",
       "to the physician, caught his hand and pressed it in both hers.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How can I thank you sir,\" she said, softly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Pshaw, Miss Annie! She owes more to you than to me. We can both\n",

       "\n",
       "One Thursday morning, twenty-six days from the time she left\n",

       "\n",
       "For one instant there was a bewildered expression as she gazed at her\n",
       "faithful watcher, who sat by her side; then she smiled, and said\n",

       "\"Lie down by me, Annie, and I'll try to sleep. You look pale and\n",
       "tired.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Annie smoothed the pillow, changed Marion's position, and then lay\n",
       "down on the outside of the bed, as she had done so many times during\n",
       "the last weary weeks.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Howard's excellent constitution is doing wonders for her,\"\n",
       "remarked Dr. Ross, as, after the crisis, she seemed to make a leap\n",
       "into the arms of health. \"No more drugs: Nature will do her own work\n",
       "now.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This was Marion's first experience of severe illness, and it was\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I feel so strong,\" she insisted, \"that I ought to be waiting on\n",

       "\n",
       "\"How do you know she is competent, Doctor? You ought to consult me,\"\n",

       "unexpected offer.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I'll test her capabilities now.  Come, Miss Annie, into the parlor,\n",

       "\n",
       "With many blushes she obeyed, and, seating herself at the piano,\n",
       "played from memory an accompaniment to a simple ballad, which she\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Teach my girls to play and sing like that,\" he exclaimed, \"and your\n",
       "fortune is made. Teach them another accomplishment, too,—to play\n",
       "when they are asked, without excuses, as you did. I more than half\n",
       "expected you would say, 'I'm all out of practice, Doctor'; or,\n",
       "'I'm far from strong.' Teach them all that, and you'll win the\n",
       "gratitude of one father.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Before Marion was able to drive out herself, she insisted that Annie\n",
       "should spend several hours every day in the open air. Indeed, she\n",
       "contrived so many errands which it was imperative must be attended\n",
       "to immediately that the young girl could not refuse.\n",
       "\n",
       "She early learned that Mary Falkner came to the city soon after the\n",
       "place in the Home for the Sick had been secured for her, that\n",
       "Dr. Moore had seen her safely in the bed in her ward, and had\n",
       "afterward had a consultation visit on her own case with Dr. Ross.\n",
       "\n",
       "She seemed to have forgotten all about her new protégés,\n",
       "Mrs. Douglass and Mrs. Cheriton; but one day, on looking over the\n",
       "cards left during her sickness, she found one which brought the\n",
       "crimson tide back to her pale cheeks.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was a card with the name in print,—Harold Angus; and underneath,\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Annie wondered what caused the pained voice and firmly set lips of\n",
       "her friend, but she only said soothingly,—\n",

       "you.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "business now, she only asked,—\"How soon will the doctor be here?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not for some hours yet. You will have time for a good nap.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Please give me my pen and paper: I must write a few words, then I\n",
       "will try to rest; and, Annie dear, will you leave me alone a few\n",
       "minutes?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The table was drawn nearer, materials for writing placed within\n",
       "reach, and Annie, after a wistful glance at her friend, left the\n",
       "chamber. If she could have looked back and seen the weary, tired,\n",
       "pained expression which came over her friend's face as she seized the\n",
       "pen, she might have doubted whether she was acting wisely to leave\n",
       "her.\n",
       "\n",
       "The note was quickly written, indeed the words were dashed off with a\n",
       "fierce energy, as though she doubted her ability to finish, unless at\n",
       "once. It read thus:—\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Harold Angus:—\n",
       "\n",
       "Life is uncertain. I hope to live to restore to you a packet from one\n",
       "whom I strongly suspect was dear to you. To find this package drove\n",
       "me home from Grantbury, where I first heard that which connected you\n",
       "in my thoughts with a young girl called Stella. I am not aware of its\n",
       "contents, and can only say now that Stella died of consumption at the\n",
       "Home for the Sick, loving and forgiving and blessing all those who\n",
       "had been dear to her.\n",
       "\n",
       "MARION HOWARD.\n",
       "\n",
       "Having sealed this, and written the address, she added this\n",
       "direction: \"If I should die, please deliver this at once;\" then,\n",
       "enclosing the whole in a blank envelope, she touched her hand-bell\n",
       "and requested Annie to place it in her desk.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I must rest my head now,\" she said; \"but first, I want you to\n",
       "promise me that, in case anything should happen to me, you will\n",
       "forward any letters you may find in my desk.  Don't look so\n",
       "frightened, dear. I shall try to get well, for I have a great deal\n",
       "to do, and life is so pleasant; but there are duties which I dared\n",
       "not defer.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "At this moment James knocked at the door, and passed in a letter just\n",
       "delivered by the postman.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is Annie Asbury's handwriting,\" explained Marion, in a glad\n",
       "voice.  \"It will soothe me to sleep, perhaps. Annie is a dear child.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The letter read thus:—\n",
       "\n",
       "DEAR MARION,—\n",
       "\n",
       "Imagine me sitting by the east window, where I can\n",
       "look out on the great elm-tree, and hear the robin-redbreasts as they\n",
       "are calling their mates to join them in a morning song. I wish you\n",
       "could see the grass. It looks greener than green, now that the sun\n",
       "is touching it. I guess somebody else is feasting his eyes on the\n",
       "emerald greensward (that's quoted), for I hear a curtain rolled up\n",
       "and window-sash raised, so I am going to quit this highfalutin style,\n",
       "and let my pen run on as it will; but, before I forget it, I must\n",
       "tell you that ever since Mr. Angus ran up to town the day he called\n",
       "to inquire for you there has been a change in him. Before that he had\n",
       "one of his worst attacks of depression, or dyspepsia, as Aunt\n",
       "Thankful calls them; but now he seems to have made up his mind not\n",
       "to give way. I don't mean that he is cheerful, and I don't know as\n",
       "I can explain what I do mean. You must see him, before you will\n",
       "understand. Last night, after prayers, ma must have noticed something\n",
       "different in him, for she went to him and held out her hand in that\n",
       "kind way of hers.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I thank you for your prayer,\" she said: \"it has done me good.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"God is my refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "As he stood with his eyes fixed full on hers, I saw a new light\n",
       "in them, as though he had said to himself, \"I'm going to take courage\n",
       "and go ahead.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "If he had seen you, and you had talked to him as you did to pa and ma\n",

       "look.\n",
       "\n",
       "I suppose you know, dear, that those foreign people went away the\n",
       "week after you did. Ma went with Mr. Angus and brought Eugene here.\n",
       "He is so beautiful he almost took my breath away; but I am sorry\n",
       "to say he is so far from good in Ethel's meaning of the word that she\n",
       "considers it necessary to pray for him very often. Not a soul would\n",
       "he obey but Mr. Angus. I laughed so much I had to go out of the room:\n",
       "there was that boy with eyes flashing, defying everybody to make him\n",
       "stop teasing the cat, and holding her up by the tail; and there was\n",
       "Ethel perfectly dumb with astonishment, eyes wide open, pale cheeks,\n",
       "and that little quiver of her lips she has when grieved. Mr. Angus\n",
       "took in the situation at once and said,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Come to me, Eugene.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "If I were an artist I would try to sketch Mr. Angus's eyes, as he\n",
       "fixed them on the defiant little fellow. There was power in them.\n",
       "I think Ethel would be frightened into fits if he looked at her in\n",
       "that way. Eugene endured it a minute and then ran, throwing his arms\n",
       "around the neck of the conqueror, who looked lovingly enough then.\n",
       "I only waited to see whether Ethel would be jealous; but the precious\n",
       "child went up and held up her sweet lips to kiss Eugene and show him\n",
       "she forgave him; then I ran to my room and had a hearty laugh all to\n",
       "myself.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Angus told ma that Eugene was a Spanish Creole, and that it is\n",
       "natural for him to be hot-blooded.\n",
       "\n",
       "Ma said you wanted me to write a whole letter about Ethel,—all her\n",
       "funny sayings and doings. I'm sorry now I didn't begin with these,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"A what?\" repeated Gardner, trying not to laugh.\n",
       "\n",

       "out laughing.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It's perspiration, dear,\" I explained.  She was a little mortified.\n",

       "\n",

       "Two weeks ago Mr. Angus asked ma to let Ethel and I go on the lake\n",

       "at her as he put her down on the cross seat in the centre, while I\n",
       "sat at one end and he at the other. There was not a sign of fear\n",
       "after that. She sat up straight, looking at him, but not saying a\n",

       "obliged to keep in-doors. She sent for her pupils, gave them lessons,\n",
       "and heard them sing and play. She sent for new music for Annie, and\n",
       "tried to interest herself in it. She purchased flowers and sent them\n",
       "to Mrs. Douglass, who, under the care of an experienced physician,\n",
       "was gaining strength daily.  The first pleasant day she resolved\n",

       "name, as nearly as she could recollect, was the same. She had always\n",
       "called her friend by her first name, and the belief grew stronger and\n",
       "stronger in her mind that he was the one to whom her dying friend\n",
       "referred. An expression on the gentleman's face had first startled\n",

       "\"Yes, sir; but I didn't think\"—she stopped abruptly, staring in his\n",
       "face, and then exclaimed, \"Oh, if I could find that packet of\n",

       "this person stood to her. I fancied he might have been her lover.\n",
       "I was young, and thought I was to keep it till called for. I remember\n",
       "thinking as she was a foreigner it was not likely it would ever be\n",

       "and especially he wanted to narrate to the dear friend who had done\n",
       "so much for him and his sister the actual experiences she now only\n",

       "named Wilson, for his maternal grandfather. A sister of my father\n",
       "came to keep house, and care for the baby. I might have helped her,\n",
       "but I fear I made her hard task harder. Stella was naturally wilful,\n",
       "strong in her likes and dislikes, capable of the warmest affections.\n",
       "She took little Will, as we always called him, to her heart, and made\n",
       "an idol of him.\n",

       "\"I grew up with little restraint. To do myself justice, I pitied\n",
       "father so much that I often went away and wept. I loved Will too;\n",

       "I did fairly well in my studies, and went home in my uniform,\n",
       "carrying a prize for good conduct. As I recall my actions at that\n",
       "time, I must have been a great nuisance. Stella told me frankly that\n",
       "she wished I would go back to school and never return. Aunt Sarah was\n",
       "almost beside herself, settling disputes between us. Poor little Will\n",

       "out on him, notwithstanding his faults. I realized that I should be\n",
       "better with the incentive of a mother's approbation to spur me on.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I was fond of children too, and in my long, enforced absence, I came\n",

       "of a soldier's commission. He lived two days after I reached home.\n",
       "I am glad to remember that he forgave me all my waywardness and\n",

       "I reproached her with having made my life miserable. I told her\n",
       "I came home resolved to be loving and patient. I reminded her that\n",
       "we were orphans, and ought to love each other; and then, as she\n",
       "called me some undeserved names, I retorted angrily that I was the\n",
       "eldest, the proper guardian of the family, and that I would use\n",
       "my authority to take Will from her to prevent his being ruined.\n",
       "\n",

       "and entered the house. Will was alone. Stella, not expecting me,\n",
       "had left him by himself, for a punishment. He looked guiltily in my\n",

       "You were mother's pet and pride. Father could scarcely see a fault\n",
       "in his big, brave, and beautiful boy. When Aunt Sarah came, all that\n",
       "I could say to prejudice her against you had no effect. She loved and\n",
       "trusted you. She said you would love me if I would let you. She said\n",

       "If you had been plain and unattractive, I think it would have been\n",
       "different with me,—but perhaps not, for my heart was full of envy\n",
       "and jealousy. Now you know the secret of all my conduct. I was\n",
       "possessed with a devil and, instead of trying to cast him out,\n",
       "I cherished him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Harold, before you reached home to see father die he begged me\n",
       "to love you as I loved Will. He gave Will into your special care.\n",

       "for your future, that he left the care of Will's education and his\n",
       "little property to you. If he died, it was to be yours. If you died,\n",

       "back. To punish him, I shut him up in the room, forgetting that you\n",
       "had placed your gun behind the door. In my insane terror I charged\n",
       "you with murdering him, Harold. Before he died he confessed that he\n",
       "had loaded it,—put in the very bullet that was to end his life.\n",
       "Harold, can you forgive me when I say that I knew this when I saw you\n",
       "at his funeral, and did not tell you? Yes, when I saw you so changed\n",
       "that I scarcely recognized you, I kept his dying messages, which\n",
       "would have relieved your sorrow. I charged you with being his\n",
       "murderer, but no one believed me. Aunt Sarah did you justice. She\n",
       "told every one you loved the boy, and that he loved you,—that it\n",
       "was an accident. After Will confessed that he loaded the gun,\n",
       "she repeated this to every one. You were pitied, and I, who so\n",
       "idolized the boy, was looked on with suspicion. Even Aunt Sarah told\n",
       "me that I had ruined Will by indulgence, or he would never have\n",
       "touched the gun contrary to your orders. I hated her for saying it,\n",

       "stronger this morning, I will write while I can. I shall commit this\n",
       "to the care of a dear friend, who first led me to hope for pardon\n",
       "through Christ. I can never tell any one how much she has been to me.\n",
       "Beautiful, accomplished, and rich, she devotes herself and all she\n",
       "has to the divine work of winning others to her Saviour.\n",
       "Dear brother, I wish you could meet such a friend. If you have never\n",
       "sought Christ let a sister's dying words prevail. His love is more\n",
       "precious than all the world beside. If I, with all my load of guilt\n",
       "can receive forgiveness, no one need despair. I told you I would\n",
       "never forgive you. One day I heard a sermon from the young chaplain\n",
       "of the Home, where I was staying. He repeated the words of our\n",
       "Saviour, \"If ye forgive not men their trespasses,\" etc., and\n",

       "a spirit of unforgiveness.\n",
       "\n",
       "Every word applied to my case. The gracious spirit of God carried\n",
       "home the truth to my heart, and helped me to accept his conditions\n",
       "of mercy. The whole room seemed filled with light. Never had I\n",
       "conceived such joy, such peace, as flowed in upon my soul.\n",
       "From trying to invent excuses for my own base conduct, I saw myself\n",
       "the vilest of the vile.  I realize now that murder had been in my\n",
       "heart,—murder of a brother. I love you now. I wonder at your\n",
       "forbearance when I reproached you. How pityingly you used to gaze\n",
       "on me! I seem to see your eyes now,—eyes like our mother's,\n",
       "so sweet, so sad,—looking into mine as though you would say,\n",
       "\"Stella, I want to love you. Why can't we be at peace?\" O Harold,\n",
       "my brother, would that I could see you once more and ask your\n",
       "forgiveness!  Aunt Sarah often said that I had driven you from home\n",
       "and friends. It is true. I grieve over it, and have asked God\n",
       "to forgive me. I pray that we may meet in heaven: you will forgive me\n",

       "\n",
       "Before I close, I must tell you that immediately after Will's death\n",
       "I went home with Aunt Sarah, and remained till she died. In the bank\n",
       "where father left your money, you will find my share and Will's.\n",
       "I have never drawn one pound.  I could not, as I had made it over\n",
       "to you. My legacy has sufficed. I want you to accept mine (Will's is\n",
       "yours by right) from a sister who has learned not only to love but to\n",
       "admire you. I found letters from your teachers in the military school\n",
       "to father. They wrote of you in the highest terms. Father used to\n",
       "read them over and over. I did not see them till after his death.\n",
       "\n",
       "One favor I would like to ask.  If you ever receive this, will you\n",
       "repay the faithful friend I have mentioned the amount she has\n",
       "expended for my lot in Greenwood,—she has promised to follow me\n",
       "there,—and any other expense incurred for my sickness beyond the\n",

       "Later.—The end is drawing near. I am not afraid: Christian friends\n",
       "are about me.  My own loved Marion will be here presently, and will\n",
       "not leave me till Jesus, my Saviour calls me home. I have an\n",
       "assurance this morning that my prayers for you will be answered.\n",

       "Miss Howard heard me sing once at a party given by one of my pupils\n",
       "and afterward called when she learned I was sick.  She is a great\n",

       "Still, wherever she went, however employed her thoughts were with\n",

       "away money on bummers, stuff and nonsense—embryo thieves and\n",
       "murderers.\" He walked to the window, pretended to be examining the\n",
       "flowers in the conservatory, pulled out his purse and quickly\n",
       "concealed a bill in his hand just as Marion, who had finished her\n",

       "\"You needn't try to deceive me with your grumbling: I found you out\n",

       "\n",
       "He sat down and wiped the perspiration from his forehead, looking so\n",
       "pale and hurt that Marion pitied him more than ever. She drew a chair\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Now that we understand each other, I want to tell you a story,—\n",
       "a true one. You know Hepsey and I go out sometimes to see our friends\n",
       "in the back alleys.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"One day I heard a woman crying,—and true enough she had cause.\n",
       "Her boy had been crushed by a wheel which ran over his legs;\n",
       "and there he lay on a pile of straw, in a fainting fit. I tried\n",
       "to bring him to while Hepsey went for an ambulance, and we soon had\n",
       "him in the care of the doctor, on his way to the hospital. Hepsey and\n",
       "I followed with the mother. To make a long story short, the injury\n",
       "was so great that Neddy—that's his name—had both his legs\n",
       "amputated just above the knees, and he is well again. Now the\n",
       "question is, What can he do to earn his living? He's a dear, patient\n",
       "little fellow, and he has made friends of everybody at the hospital.\n",
       "One of the doctors has given me five dollars for—\"\n",

       "to the convalescent ward. The boy was sitting in a low chair, which\n",
       "he had learned to wheel about with great rapidity. As soon as he saw\n",

       "\"I wish I had seen him,\" was Marion's answer. \"What did he come for?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To see me. He was awful cross at first, and scolded me for getting\n",
       "under the wheel like sixty; but I know him, and he's real good for\n",
       "all that; and I like him; and when I told him I didn't get under the\n",

       "he coaxed them to sit in his lap and put their hands in his pockets,\n",
       "where they found nuts and raisins and candy in abundance. A lady came\n",
       "in to see a little cripple, and as she passed him surrounded by a\n",
       "group of them, Neddy's chair rolled as close as he could get it,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Yes, miss. Me and another boy got into a fight, and I had my head\n",

       "half-starved dog of which he seemed very fond. Just then a big bully\n",
       "of a boy met them, and began to tease the dog. When his owner timidly\n",
       "begged to be let alone, the bully flew at him, and then Maurice\n",
       "thought it time to interfere. He caught the bully by the hair, and\n",
       "would not let go till he was terribly bruised. A policeman came up\n",
       "and arrested both the boys, just as Maurice fainted from loss of\n",
       "blood. The gentleman had seen the whole fight from beginning to end,\n",
       "and he followed the bully to the court-room and gave his testimony,\n",
       "and called Maurice a hero.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And a good fighter, too,\" added Maurice, who had stood by, listening\n",
       "to all with a kind of proud humility.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am glad you were not fighting to defend your own rights,\" said\n",
       "Marion, approvingly. \"But who was the gentleman?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He gave his name as Lambert,\" said the nurse. \"There is a very\n",
       "curious sequel to the story,\" she added, in a low tone, as they\n",
       "turned away.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mr. Lambert came here twice before Maurice was well enough to know\n",
       "him, and showed a good deal of anxiety till he was out of danger,\n",
       "growling to himself that he ought to have stopped the fight earlier.\n",
       "He gave the doctor some money for Maurice when he goes away; but the\n",
       "boy knows nothing of that yet. When Mr. Lambert saw Maurice\n",
       "he scolded him well; said a street fighter was a mean fellow and\n",
       "ought to be arrested, and hoped he should never hear of his street\n",
       "brawls again.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"His voice was so loud that some of the little ones began to cry,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I'd fight for you, sir, to-morrow, if you was hit. I know you're\n",
       "jolly, for all your scolding.'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well,\" said Marion, laughing heartily, \"what did Mr. Lambert say\n",
       "to that?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not a word that we could understand. He went away with his\n",

       "\n",
       "Standing in the midst of the ward, with the little ones pressing\n",
       "to her side, Marion sang the sweet melody set to the words,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Will you come where the sweet-briar grows,\n",

       "MISS HOWARD was leaving the hospital when she met the doctor\n",
       "in charge, who invited her to his private parlor, as he wished\n",
       "to consult her in regard to her protégé Neddy Carter.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I suppose you are acquainted with Mr. Regy,' he said. \"He knew your\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I know him well by report,\" she answered, \"but I have never seen\n",
       "him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Indeed! He is certainly the most eccentric individual I ever met.\n",
       "Benevolent and tender-hearted to an extreme, he seems to me like a\n",
       "man who has learned to mistrust humanity so generally that he hides\n",
       "every evidence of weakness as carefully as though it were a crime.\n",
       "Why, the good deeds that man does almost defy belief.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I can easily credit your statement, doctor. In my visits to my poor\n",
       "friends, I am constantly hearing of him. I have known of his paying\n",
       "rent for a widow who had a sick daughter, month after month, and at\n",
       "the same time providing her with medicines and food. Yet he would\n",
       "talk to her about her untidyness till he made her cry; and then he\n",
       "would go away grumbling that all he could say did no good.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I heard some facts concerning his eccentricities from a gentleman\n",
       "who owns the place next his in the country,\" continued the doctor,\n",
       "\"which, if they had not come to me from the best authority I would\n",
       "not credit; but my friend vouches for the facts.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Near them lives a woman whose husband was killed on the railroad.\n",
       "She has two young children, is pleasing in appearance, but wanting\n",
       "in force. They had always lived in comfort, on the wages her husband\n",
       "earned. When he was killed, she seemed crushed with grief.\n",
       "The neighbors made up a purse for her, and Mr. Regy, who had given\n",
       "generously, was requested to carry it to her. He learned that she\n",
       "owned her small cottage, to which a barn was attached, but had no\n",
       "money. He found she had no idea of earning her own living, but when\n",
       "he proposed that the children be sent to the asylum, and she go out\n",
       "to work in a mill or family, she cried herself into hysterics,\n",
       "calling him a cruel, hard-hearted brute for proposing it, wished he\n",
       "would go away and never come again.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This is all my friend learned from Mr. Regy, who denounced her\n",
       "as ungrateful, unnatural as a mother, a pest to society.\n",
       "Her neighbors supposed, of course, he gave her up; but he never did,\n",
       "for a day. He went and berated her till he quite roused her into\n",
       "action; and finally she said she had been brought up on a farm,\n",
       "and knew how to make butter and cheese.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"'What good will that do you?' he asked her, with a sneer. 'Where\n",
       "are your cows, to make butter from?'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It was some time before she learned what a true friend he was;\n",
       "but two excellent milkers found their way to her barn, and, in time,\n",
       "pans and a churn. Then she complained that she was sure she never\n",
       "could sell her butter and pot-cheese and cried a whole day at the\n",
       "scolding he gave her. To make a long story short, he sold all her\n",
       "butter and cheese for her at the highest price, taking the basket\n",
       "on his own arm, and carrying it to the houses of the regular\n",
       "customers. A lady on Forty-Second Street told my friend that he\n",
       "brought butter there regularly every week for more than a year.\n",
       "She supposed it was from his own farm; and she has a pile of his\n",
       "receipts signed M. Regy. Once she remonstrated in person with him\n",
       "for his high prices, when he flew into such a rage that she never\n",
       "dared approach the subject again.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very, very strange,\" remarked Marion.  \"I have a friend who is\n",
       "extremely odd and uncouth in manner, but is always doing kindnesses\n",
       "for the poor. His name is Lambert. In many respects your description\n",
       "of Mr. Regy would answer for both.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do you refer to Mr. M. R. Lambert, a rich old bachelor?  Why, I\n",
       "always thought him the most sarcastic, sour, crusty, old man in my\n",
       "acquaintance.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Only in manner, doctor. He possesses the milk of human kindness in\n",
       "an uncommon degree. He is a second Mr. Regy. I am confident that any\n",
       "sum of money I would consent to ask him for in behalf of my protégés\n",
       "would not be refused; and all the time he would be grumbling that it\n",
       "was good money thrown away on a thankless class of vagrants.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What is Mr. Lambert's full address,\" inquired the doctor, rising in\n",
       "an excited manner.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"M. R. Lambert are his initials. I have scores of his cards.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Regy is, I believe, his middle name, and he uses it for a nom de\n",
       "plume. It can scarcely be credited that there would be two so similar\n",
       "in their eccentricities. I am almost sure of it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then he must disguise himself: Mr. Lambert's hair is short, and only\n",
       "beginning to turn gray.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A gray wig is easy to procure. What can be his motive?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is difficult to conceive, Doctor. I have sometimes imagined that\n",
       "Mr. Lambert had a motive in so constantly visiting the poorer\n",
       "classes; but it is only a suspicion. I feel sure, if it were true,\n",
       "it would do honor to the kindness of the man. I told him the story\n",
       "of Neddy Carter's injury. He entered into it with great interest,-\n",
       "said he would get him a place in a printing-office and was almost\n",
       "angry that any one else had thought of purchasing artificial legs for\n",
       "the boy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Just what I wished to tell you from Mr. Regy. They are one and the\n",
       "same. Mr. Regy I shall continue to call him. See, here is the address\n",
       "he gave me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"M. REGY, P.O. BOX 1009.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "On her way home, Marion's thoughts were absorbed in trying to solve\n",
       "the motives which could govern such a man as Mr. Lambert, and induce\n",
       "him to figure in so many different characters; for the more she\n",
       "reflected the more she felt assured that he and Mr. Regy were the\n",
       "same. It might be that some early disappointment had thus twisted and\n",
       "gnarled a naturally lovely character.  It might be that some one\n",
       "he had once loved and trusted had betrayed his confidence, and thus\n",
       "rendered him suspicious of all mankind. She resolved to watch him\n",
       "closely, and to endeavor to lighten his burden, whatever it might be.\n",
       "\n",
       "Approaching her own door, she perceived a carriage standing there.\n",
       "With her thoughts still on the discovery she had made, she ran up the\n",
       "steps and encountered Eugene Cheriton struggling in the arms of\n",
       "James, who had been told to take him back to his mother in the\n",
       "parlor.\n",
       "\n",
       "The boy readily yielded to her wish, and went upstairs with her,\n",
       "where she was both surprised and pleased to find not only\n",
       "Mrs. Cheriton but Mrs. Douglass awaiting her arrival.\n",
       "\n",
       "The latter lady seemed to have taken out a new lease of life, since\n",
       "her return to the city. She acknowledged that she liked New York,\n",
       "and should leave it with reluctance.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I hope you do not intend to leave it,\" urged Marion.\n",

       "\"Necessity may compel us to do so.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Cheriton's countenance had no reflection of her mother's\n",
       "anxiety. She sat as usual, with her handsome head thrown a little\n",
       "back, her large, black eyes lustrous as ever, her lips wreathed\n",
       "in the same set smile; but there seemed no soul in her face.\n",
       "She appeared to have wrapped herself in a veil, which, in Marion's\n",
       "presence, had never been lifted for one instant.\n",
       "\n",
       "Eugene, beautiful and restless as ever, ran here and there\n",
       "unrestrained, demanding the reason for this or that, preventing\n",
       "so effectually any attempt at conversation that Marion, who wished\n",
       "for an opportunity to talk with Mrs. Douglass, at last persuaded her\n",
       "to remain for the day, insisting that she herself had no engagements\n",
       "which would interfere with the pleasure of such a visit.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"While you are taking your siesta,\" she urged, \"I can go to my\n",
       "pupils; and then we will have quiet chat, or drive in the park,\n",
       "as you prefer.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This is just the opportunity I have long desired,\" remarked Mrs.\n",
       "Douglass, as after an hour's rest she had partaken of a nice lunch,\n",
       "and was seated in Marion's most comfortable chair. \"I want to tell\n",
       "you some facts in my early life which will account for my being here\n",
       "in America.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I shall feel honored by your confidence,\" returned Marion, gazing\n",
       "with affection into the still beautiful face, so like and yet unlike\n",

       "as we please.\"\n",

       "\n",
       "\"My father was an Englishman, and in his thirty-first year was sent\n",

       "Madrid, where he met my mother, daughter of a nobleman in that city.\n",
       "The liking between them was mutual, and ended in marriage after an\n",

       "\"A year after their marriage a son was born, who was named Henreich,\n",

       "GRANTBURY AND THE FIRST CHURCH.\n",
       "\n",
       "GRANTBURY is a manufacturing town. It has six churches, of the\n",
       "different denominations. The largest and most flourishing church\n",
       "was the one over which Mr. Angus was settled as pastor. A branch\n",
       "of this church had gone off some years before and had built a chapel\n",
       "near one of the factories, hoping to bring in many of the employés,\n",
       "who were neglectful of public worship. This had not been as\n",
       "successful as had been hoped; the clergyman was so poorly supported\n",
       "that he left, and of late the effort of the Christian workers had\n",
       "been concentrated on the Sunday school.  The usual attendance here\n",
       "was about one hundred.\n",
       "\n",
       "Two years before the commencement of our story, an unusual excitement\n",
       "prevailed in the town, caused by the proposition of a few speculators\n",
       "to build a new railroad direct to the principal cities east and west\n",
       "of them, thus connecting them with the great thoroughfares.\n",
       "The capitalists who owned most of the stock in the branch railroad\n",
       "which connected them three times in a day with the next town at first\n",
       "opposed the new project; but Mr. Asbury, with a wider and more\n",
       "far-reaching view of the results, advocated it both by public\n",
       "speeches and offers of money.\n",
       "\n",
       "As he was a large land-owner, and the railroad would have to pass\n",
       "through one of his most valuable farms, it was argued by those\n",
       "wishing the new road, that he must be advocating it for the good\n",
       "of the public against his private interests.  So, indeed, he was.\n",
       "The new road was chartered, and in time in working order.\n",
       "A compromise to purchase from the owners of the branch road twelve\n",
       "miles which came in their direct route satisfied all parties;\n",
       "so that, when, the new, tasteful depot with the long baggage-room\n",
       "replaced the forlorn little station with shed attached, there was\n",
       "a general burst of enthusiasm.\n",
       "\n",
       "The two years following this made a marvelous change in the old,\n",
       "quiet village. Mr. Asbury had given a beautiful site for the new\n",
       "depot, on conditions which had been complied with. The grass land\n",
       "belonging to his largest farm had been laid out in squares, with\n",
       "a park in the centre, and sold for house lots. The buildings put up\n",
       "there according to the terms of sale, must not be less than a\n",
       "stipulated cost; and thus a pretty village was growing up in this\n",
       "part of the town.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Angus's church was half a mile from the station, and quite near\n",
       "Mr. Asbury's dwelling house. The stimulus in all branches of business\n",
       "had been so great since the new railroad had been built that the main\n",
       "street had been widened, and set out with shade trees at the border\n",
       "of the flagged sidewalks.\n",
       "\n",
       "Nor was the prosperity confined to the vicinity of the depot.\n",
       "The increased demand for vegetables, milk, etc., from the new-comers\n",
       "made the land too valuable for the farmers to cultivate grass and\n",
       "corn for their own use. Large fields with southern exposures were\n",
       "planted with early and late vegetables and small fruits, which found\n",
       "a ready sale at their own new market.\n",
       "\n",
       "This was the condition of the town when Mr. Angus became the pastor\n",
       "of the First Church.  During the nine months following his\n",
       "ordination, the church building had become so crowded that a\n",
       "suggestion of enlarging by transepts had been made. It was an\n",
       "old-fashioned edifice, with unnecessarily roomy slips, white walls,\n",
       "high pulpit, and poor ventilation. Mr. Asbury was opposed to\n",
       "enlarging, but did not consider it time to give his reasons.\n",
       "\n",
       "At a meeting of the trustees directly after Mr. Angus went abroad,\n",
       "it was proposed that the work of enlarging be entered upon\n",
       "immediately, and finished by the time of the pastor's return.\n",
       "Some money was subscribed; but when the paper was passed to\n",
       "Mr. Asbury, he refused to sign any thing. As a large subscription\n",
       "had been hoped for, this refusal threw a damper on the undertaking;\n",
       "but a committee was appointed to report in one week, and the meeting\n",
       "adjourned.\n",
       "\n",
       "During this very week a fire broke out in carpenter's shop filled\n",
       "with combustible matter. The flames carried sparks and half-burned\n",
       "sticks to several houses in the vicinity, and among them to the\n",
       "building belonging to the First Church. The committee met, and all\n",
       "the male members with them, not to report on the cost of the proposed\n",
       "alterations, but to consult what was to be done in this sudden and\n",
       "terrible emergency.\n",
       "\n",
       "The old sturdy farmers were near despair, but supposed they must do\n",
       "something to repair the temple of the Lord, and were thankful that\n",
       "the walls, being of brick, were still standing.\n",
       "\n",
       "Others had a plan that a new town hall, just finished, should be\n",
       "hired, and public worship held there till such time as they were able\n",
       "to recover from the effects of the terrible calamity which had\n",
       "overtaken them.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Asbury and a few friends belonging to the wealthy portion of the\n",
       "church remained silent listeners to the views of the older brethren.\n",
       "At length, after an hour spent in lamentations over the calamity, and\n",
       "propositions which were considered impracticable, the moderator\n",
       "of the meeting remarked,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We have talked an hour to no purpose. Will some one make a\n",
       "proposition as to a place of worship for us next Sunday?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "After a momentary pause, Mr. Asbury quietly rose from his seat\n",
       "with an open paper in his hand. There was not the least trace of\n",
       "excitement in his manner, as he said, \"I have here a letter, which I\n",
       "will read. It is from the trustees of the Methodist Episcopal Church\n",
       "in our town, and is addressed to me.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"MR. EDWARD ASBURY:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Dear Sir, At a meeting of our board of trustees the day following\n",

       "that we deeply sympathize in your loss of your house of worship, and\n",
       "that we tender to you the free use of our church building till such\n",
       "time as you may repair your edifice or otherwise provide for\n",
       "yourselves.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I have a proposition to make; but, first, I ask you to listen to a\n",
       "few facts. I have made a careful investigation into the state of our\n",
       "church building, the walls of which are still standing. It is\n",
       "fifty-eight years old; the beams are rotten. It ought to be a source\n",
       "of gratitude that we have escaped a greater calamity by reason of the\n",
       "falling in of the walls, from the cellar being unventilated.\n",
       "It cannot be repaired. This is the opinion of the best experts I have\n",
       "been able to obtain. I propose, then, that we sell it as it stands,\n",
       "to some gentlemen who offer five thousand dollars for the site.\n",
       "They intend, if they obtain it, to put up a large hotel.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\"Take it.\"\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"We need a hotel for summer residents.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We can worship in the town hall.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Or disband altogether,\" grumbled a man who never contributed a\n",
       "penny.\n",
       "\n",
       "Altogether the clamor following this proposition prevented any\n",
       "further remarks from Mr. Asbury, if he had wished to make any, and he\n",
       "sat down with a smile on his face.\n",
       "\n",
       "Several groups were at once formed, and loud, excited voices were\n",
       "heard discussing this unexpected proposal; some were for accepting,\n",
       "others positively refused to quit the old spot dedicated by their\n",
       "fathers to the worship of God. At length the moderator, with a loud\n",
       "rap on the table, called the meeting to order, and inquired whether\n",
       "any gentleman had anything further to say before the proposal was put\n",
       "to vote.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Asbury rose again, this time with a little flush on his face,\n",
       "as he remarked, \"I am not in the habit, as you, my friends, are\n",
       "aware, of speaking of myself; but I would like to say that I have the\n",
       "welfare of this parish greatly at heart. We are blessed with a good\n",
       "pastor,—a live, working man. I believe he will be more useful in\n",
       "the future than he has been in the past; that he is a growing man.\n",
       "I believe that he will return to us with greatly improved health and\n",
       "spirits, and enter on his work again with new hope and confidence of\n",
       "success. I want to show him that we appreciate him by building him\n",
       "a new church large enough to accommodate all the new families who\n",
       "wish to join us. When a proposition was made at our last meeting\n",
       "to enlarge our old building, I did not subscribe, because I knew the\n",
       "work would cost more in the end than to begin a new one. I have had\n",
       "some sad experience, as many of you know\" (smiling), \"as to the cost\n",
       "of repairing old buildings. Now that the fire has rendered that\n",
       "undertaking impracticable, I propose to your board of trustees\n",
       "to accept a lot of land on the rising ground, half-way between this\n",
       "and the new depot, which I freely tender to them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Shouts of \"Yes,\" \"We will,\" etc., were checked by a wave of\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Wait a little: I have not done yet; there are conditions. I wish\n",

       "edifice costing not less than twenty thousand dollars, and the sum of\n",
       "fourteen thousand eight hundred dollars, including five thousand for\n",
       "our old church building, already subscribed, on condition that the\n",
       "whole amount be raised, and no mortgage ever be allowed upon it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Profound silence followed this speech, which was like a bombshell\n",
       "thrown into an unprotected house; then a few whispers were heard,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Five thousand and more to raise. Where will it come from?\"\n",

       "in my opinion, is the pootiest place for a church in the hull town,—\n",
       "yes, and to worship God in it, too. I'm not rich, and I'm not poor.\n",
       "I've got nigh upon two thousand dollars in the savings bank, laid up\n",

       "same sum as he did.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "After the opening exercises, Mr. Asbury stated the object of the\n",

       "\n",
       "\"What a pretty name Ingleside is,\" remarked Marion, without raising\n",
       "her eyes from her work. She was making a fine dress for Frances,\n",
       "Ethel's favorite doll, and of course the excitement of this was what\n",
       "made her cheeks look so rosy.\n",
       "\n",
       "During Ethel's visits Marion invited Geenie Cheriton to take a drive\n",
       "with them and pass the rest of the day with the little girl. They all\n",
       "gave a sigh of relief, however, when James started with him for his\n",
       "home, and Mrs. Asbury said,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I wonder how Mrs. Douglass can endure that child's noise. It is such\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I wouldn't be that boy's nurse for a fortune,\" exclaimed Hepsey,\n",
       "who was putting up the toys Geenie had pulled about. \"They'll have\n",
       "a time with him if he lives.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Lambert called during Mrs. Asbury's visit, and was introduced\n",
       "to the guests. He seemed greatly attracted by Ethel, who fixed her\n",
       "large violet eyes seriously upon him. He succeeded at last in coaxing\n",
       "her to his side, when they had quite an animated conversation.\n",
       "Before they parted he gave her a beautiful little charm, whist he\n",
       "unhooked from his watch-chain.\n",
       "\n",
       "This was the first time Marion had seen him since her discovery that\n",
       "Mr. Regy, of whom she had heard so much, was only the double of her\n",
       "old friend. She longed to ask him about it, but would not before\n",
       "strangers. She contented herself with inquiries about Neddy Carter,\n",
       "who was soon to be admitted to the mission school.\n",
       "\n",
       "Only two days after Mrs. Asbury's return to Grantbury,\n",
       "Marion received a thick letter with a foreign postmark,—Leyden,\n",
       "Yorkshire.  She retired quickly to her own chamber, and sat down with\n",
       "blooming cheeks to its perusal.\n",
       "\n",
       "I have no intention of copying the letter, but will say that, after\n",
       "giving her an account of his visit to his home,—a visit which\n",
       "almost overwhelmed him with its painful memories,—and visiting the\n",
       "graves of father, mother, and brother as they lay side by side under\n",
       "the old yew-trees, he took the cars for Ingleside, his father's\n",
       "ancestral home in Leyden. He told her he found only an old servant,\n",
       "a retainer of the family, who received him as one from the dead.\n",
       "His grandfather had four children born here,—one son and three\n",
       "daughters. When he died, in Harold's twelfth year, his property was\n",
       "divided equally between them, except Ingleside, which was always\n",
       "to be kept in the family, and after the death of his daughters\n",
       "to revert to his oldest grandson.\n",
       "\n",
       "Estelle Angus, for whom Stella was named, made a will and left her\n",
       "namesake her heir. Mary and Sarah died without making a will, and the\n",
       "property came to Harold, as the nearest of kin. It was not a great\n",
       "fortune that he found awaiting him, Mr. Angus told Marion, but, with\n",
       "the money left in the bank by his father, it was sufficient to enable\n",
       "him to carry out some cherished plans.\n",
       "\n",
       "One of these plans was to build a pretty home on a certain knoll\n",
       "in Grantbury (the very one Mr. Asbury had given to the church), to be\n",
       "called Ingleside; but there was one word from her which must come\n",
       "before the new Ingleside could be built.\n",

       "Then followed certain statements in regard to a diagnosis recently\n",
       "made of his heart, which conveyed to the young lady a pretty accurate\n",

       "erected.\n",
       "\n",
       "By this time Marion, by certain unwelcome symptoms, which had forced\n",
       "themselves on her notice was aware of the strength of her own\n",
       "attachment for her pastor, and, being naturally frank and outspoken,\n",
       "she wrote the word (a very short one), which, could he have known it,\n",
       "would have set good Farmer Rand's mind at rest in regard \"to holding\n",
       "on\" to his pastor.\n",
       "\n",
       "In a note added to his letter, immediately following the receipt of\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I have just forwarded to Mr. Asbury an invitation to settle in our\n",

       "\n",
       "On entering the house where Mrs. Douglass had rooms, Marion met\n",
       "in the hall a dashing young man, dressed in the height of the\n",
       "fashion, with a lighted cigar in his hand. She would have passed him\n",
       "without notice, but for a bold stare, which sent the indignant blood\n",
       "to her cheeks.\n",
       "\n",
       "The knock at Mrs. Douglass's door was for a minute unanswered;\n",
       "then Mrs. Cheriton opened it, her eyes still flashing defiance,\n",
       "her head thrown back, but looking more brilliantly beautiful than the\n",
       "visitor had ever seen her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Douglass had evidently been under some strong excitement:\n",
       "her eyes were red with crying, and her hands trembled.\n",
       "\n",
       "Eugene came forward with a rush to meet the lady. He was dressed for\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I did. I can guess that he is Mr. Cheriton.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, no! no! Would that he were here. Juliette is so young: she does\n",
       "not consider; she is—I am pained to say so—she is imprudent.\n",
       "Arthur has no right to leave her unprotected. She wrung her hands\n",
       "in great distress, her eyes full of tears.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Who is he?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"His name is Alford. Juliette accompanied one of our fellow-boarders\n",
       "to the theatre, and was introduced to him there. He has been here\n",
       "every day since. She has just promised, in my presence, and contrary\n",
       "to my wishes, to go to the theatre with him to-night. I am powerless\n",
       "to prevent it. What must I, what can I do?\"\n",

       "\n",
       "\"A very indefinite address. Will you let me take it? I will make\n",

       "\n",
       "\"But Juliette has a husband. Whatever his moral character may be,\n",

       "\n",
       "Seldom had the young Christian poured forth such earnest petitions\n",

       "young wife, the excuses she would make to her conscience,—that her\n",
       "husband had forsaken her,—the impossibility of earthly effort\n",
       "to restrain her, Marion called upon God to appear for them in their\n",

       "in her path to ruin, to fill her soul with purer joys.\n",
       "\n",
       "Feeling as she did at that moment, perhaps as never before,\n",

       "future was opening before her own path, her tears gushed forth afresh\n",
       "at the thought of the dangers threatening this beautiful, unprotected\n",
       "child-wife. She prayed too that the absent husband might be brought\n",
       "to a sense of his wrong-doing in forsaking her whom he had sworn\n",
       "to cherish, and return to them with new purposes and new resolves.\n",
       "Nor did she forget the absent father, so long unknown to those\n",
       "connected with him by the closest ties. She prayed that if he were\n",
       "still an inhabitant of earth, God, who knew all things, would lead\n",
       "him back to them, to be their comfort and joy.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"O Miss Howard!\" cried the afflicted mother, clasping her hands,\n",
       "\"what a blessing that we can go to our heavenly Father and tell him\n",
       "all our sorrows! I have an assurance that He will answer; that He\n",
       "will in some way protect my dear, deluded child. It may be by my\n",
       "death. I would willingly give up my life, could I be assured of her\n",
       "safety. It may be that He will touch Arthur's heart, and bring him\n",
       "home to his family. I would submit to any privation, any\n",
       "inconvenience, to have him, her lawful protector, with her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Or,\" added Marion, \"He may restore to you the husband you have\n",
       "so long mourned. A father would be a great blessing to Juliette now.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A Christian father,\" murmured the lady, raising her eyes to heaven.\n",

       "Thyself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "After a short silence, the lady added, \"I thank God I can say with\n",
       "truth that, since the hour my husband left me, believing I was lost\n",
       "to virtue, I have always maintained the strictest reserve toward all\n",
       "of the opposite sex. I was young, and often called handsome.\n",
       "I believe my husband had been proud of my beauty. I could play the\n",
       "piano and guitar as an accompaniment to my voice; but I only played\n",
       "for my parents and most intimate friends. I have always tried\n",
       "to impress upon Juliette, both by example and precept, that a wife\n",
       "so unfortunately situated must be doubly guarded in her conduct.\n",
       "Character is a plant which must be kept in good soil, free from\n",
       "blights and mildew. It must be watched and tended with care. It is\n",

       "color crimsoned her cheeks when she was excited either by joy or\n",
       "anger. Eugene, too, seemed overflowing with spirits. His hands were\n",
       "full of toys and sweetmeats, given him, he said, by the nice\n",
       "gentleman. When he threw off his cap, his grandmother noticed that\n",
       "his hair was wet with perspiration, and told her daughter he ought\n",

       "breath.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is a case of life and death,\" added the physician, in a solemn\n",

       "Addressing one of the servants, who had just returned with the\n",

       "\n",

       "used, a short time would end the struggle. Taking Eugene in his own\n",
       "arms, he directed the girl to wrap the boy in the large blanket and\n",
       "hold him over the boiling water. The other girl was to furnish\n",
       "a fresh supply.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Douglass tried to persuade her daughter to leave the room;\n",
       "but she would not. She sank into a chair and watched every movement\n",

       "light up the room.\n",
       "\n",
       "In half an hour the medicine began to take effect, the terrible\n",
       "sound, never to be forgotten, grew less harsh. The doctor, with his\n",
       "coat off, worked like a hero. It was evident that the steam produced\n",
       "relief in breathing. More and more heavily drooped the child's head,\n",
       "his eyelids closed, the terrible heaving of his breast was more\n",
       "natural. The doctor put his hand under the blanket, found the pulse,\n",
       "and nodded approval.  Without awakening the boy, he put a small\n",
       "powder on his tongue and sat down to watch.\n",
       "\n",
       "Another hour passed. Mrs. Douglass had quietly retired to the next\n",

       "like to leave his patient till assured that he would have no return\n",
       "of the frightful convulsions. He was a father too, and aside from his\n",
       "desire as a physician to control the disease, he was interested\n",
       "in the unusual circumstances of the patient. At home, he had a\n",
       "daughter growing up, now in her seventeenth year, who looked more fit\n",
       "to be a mother than this passionate girl, who at one moment gave free\n",
       "vent to her frenzied agony, and the next controlled herself so\n",

       "of her outward charms, undutiful to her long-suffering,\n",
       "self-sacrificing mother,—her best friend,—idolizing her boy,\n",
       "but blind to his faults, and not restraining her own temper that she\n",
       "might teach him self-control. Then her thoughts reverted to her\n",
       "absent husband, and conscience, resolved to be heard at last,\n",
       "set before her a catalogue of her offences toward him,—wilful\n",
       "neglect of his wishes, too evident want of affection, etc., which had\n",
       "at last weaned him from her and sent him far away. \"Where is he now?\"\n",

       "to read a few verses in the Bible. I found verses written expressly\n",

       "and then, throwing herself on her knees by the bed, she hid her face\n",
       "in her hands and poured out from a thankful heart prayer for Christ's\n",
       "presence, such as he had promised his disciples, and praise for the\n",
       "blessed hope of acceptance and pardon. With the simplicity of a child\n",
       "who has scarcely learned the language of prayer, but whose soul\n",
       "is fully alive to the value of the blessings to be asked for,\n",
       "she plead for wisdom equal to every emergency, grace for every trial\n",

       "according to his will.  \"But, oh, dear Jesus, who loves little\n",

       "Marion's place, arranging her still abundant hair. They were engaged\n",
       "in animated conversation when he entered. He had become deeply\n",
       "interested in the strangers, having never forgotten the scenes\n",
       "of the night of his introduction to them. To no one had he ever\n",
       "mentioned the young mother's prayer, the burden of which was help\n",
       "for herself from some great danger, not for relief and returning\n",
       "health to her child.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are better,\" he said, cheerfully, after having counted her\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Wine? I wish you had taken it sooner.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, Doctor. I have heard my daughter pray.\" The mother's face beamed\n",
       "with joy.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What is so great a beautifier as happiness?\" was the doctor's\n",
       "thought. \"She looks ten years younger.\" He spoke seriously, but with\n",
       "the greatest tenderness, saying,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have heard her pray, and I think her prayers have been answered.\n",
       "She has borne the trials of these sad weeks with a sweet submission\n",

       "\n",
       "\"God has given her grace according to her day.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes. He has indeed fulfilled His promise to the widow and orphan.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My daughter is not a widow, Doctor,\" murmured the patient, her\n",
       "cheeks flushing. \"You have been such a kind friend, I may confide\n",
       "so much of our story to you. Juliette was married at the early age\n",
       "of fourteen, and her child was born within the year. Geenie was only\n",
       "a few weeks old when his father left home for England, ostensibly\n",
       "to obtain a situation where he might support his family in the\n",
       "luxuries to which they had been accustomed. We hear from him\n",
       "occasionally, but have never seen him since.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Unnatural monster!\" cried the doctor, indignantly. He thought\n",
       "of his own little girl, and wondered how she would endure such\n",
       "a living trial,—she to whom the loss of a pet dog had been the\n",
       "greatest grief she had known.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was a minute or two before he could rally sufficiently to remark,\n",
       "\"Eugene is better too. I am sorry to say my patient will soon be\n",
       "dismissing me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We have so few friends in America, we cannot give up your visits\n",
       "without regret, Doctor. But it is selfish for us to keep you longer\n",
       "than is necessary, when so many need you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is a physician to have no friends, then?\" queried the doctor,\n",
       "assuming a gruff voice. \"You will find it hard, madam, to get rid\n",
       "of me.\"  Then, with an emphatic shrug of his shoulders, he went away,\n",
       "and drove nearly a mile out of his course, while he was wondering\n",
       "what kind of a man Mr. Cheriton could be who would forsake a wife\n",
       "like Juliette.\n",
       "\n",
       "In another respect the young mother showed that she had taken God's\n",
       "word as the rule of her life. This was in the management of her\n",
       "child. Formerly, when herself provoked at his rudeness or impatient\n",
       "at his exactions, she had dealt him a sudden blow, which, however,\n",
       "always seemed to rouse his combativeness to such a degree that it\n",
       "required much skill to soothe him. She usually had to buy him off\n",
       "from the exhibition of temper by confectionery or some new toys.\n",
       "Now, feeling her own weakness, she daily sought strength from God.\n",
       "She had noticed, too, how easily Mr. Angus and Marion had made him\n",
       "obey, not by blows or threats, but by a firm and gentle kindness,\n",
       "which won his confidence. It was her aim to imitate this method.\n",
       "\n",
       "As soon as he was able to sit up, Eugene felt rather than understood\n",
       "that his mother would no longer submit to be struck in the face\n",
       "or called \"bad mamma\" when his wishes were crossed. She talked\n",
       "to him, explained that he must obey, that Jesus Christ loved good\n",
       "children, and that she would teach him to pray, and ask this best\n",
       "Friend to help him be good.\n",
       "\n",
       "There is a sacredness in religious teachings which always arrests\n",
       "the attention of a child. No stories are so much delighted in\n",
       "as the stories of Joseph and Samuel and Daniel, and particularly\n",
       "the story of our dear Saviour. Over and over again these stories\n",
       "may be repeated; yet the little one never tires, but will ask\n",
       "new questions concerning the wonderful characters.\n",
       "\n",
       "Juliette had thus a double incentive to read her Bible. She wished\n",

       "\n",
       "Marion came in one day and found Geenie dressed in a wrapper, sitting\n",
       "in his mother's lap. In her hand she held the Good Book, and they\n",
       "were talking eagerly of the story she had read.  Marion wrote\n",
       "afterwards, in her letter to Mr. Angus, that she seldom had seen\n",
       "a prettier picture,—the beauty of both so softened by the subjects\n",
       "on which they were talking.\n",
       "\n",
       "Marion bent over and pressed her lips to the fair forehead of the\n",

       "\n",
       "\"She's nicer than she was,\" he exclaimed, patting her cheek.\n",
       "\"She doesn't tell lies any more. She tells me when the medicine\n",

       "this trait, and wondered at it in one so young.\n",
       "\n",
       "With another child-wife it was exactly the reverse. To her earliest\n",
       "friends—Miss Howard and Hepsey—Esther laid bare all that was\n",
       "in her childish and grateful heart.\n",

       "\"Would it be wicked, ma'am, to let him think I belong to him now?\"\n",

       "garments for boys and girls, given simple recipes for cooking, and\n",

       "\n",
       "WHEN Neddy Carter was carried from the hospital, he was at once\n",
       "admitted to one of the mission schools; but he begged so hard that\n",
       "he might still make his home with his mother that he was permitted\n",
       "to do so. He said nothing of his motives in preferring a bed on a\n",
       "pile of straw to a comfortable cot in the mission house, but he had\n",
       "a strong motive, which soon began to appear.\n",
       "\n",
       "Unassisted and even unknown to his best friends, he gathered a few\n",
       "little ones in his mother's garret, and then repeated to them the\n",
       "instructions he had gained. Perhaps his pleasant blue eyes, gazing so\n",
       "frankly into theirs, had made him a favorite before; or it might be\n",
       "that the sight of him, wheeling about in his chair, enduring so\n",
       "bravely the great trial that had come upon him gave him influence\n",
       "over his companions. At any rate, he had influence and he used it\n",
       "to win them to better paths.\n",
       "\n",
       "Miss Howard learned something of this, and was so rejoiced at it that\n",
       "she resolved to visit him in his home. She had never been there since\n",
       "the day of Neddy's accident, when, with Hepsey's help, she had had\n",

       "\n",
       "This visit occurred on the Sunday afternoon following her call on\n",

       "\n",
       "On Thursday of the following week she called upon the sick man, and\n",

       "a hurried note, asking him to accompany her to see a mutual friend\n",
       "on Sunday afternoon, enclosing in the note a piece of poetry she had\n",

       "young sapling. It was beautiful to behold, and gave promise\n",
       "of becoming a lofty, stalwart tree, under which many might find\n",
       "refreshing shelter. On this thrifty sapling grew an ugly wart,\n",
       "called by some horticulturists jealousy. At first it might have been\n",
       "removed without injury to the tree, but it was not. It grew and grew,\n",
       "diffusing it: poison through all the cellular tissues, until it\n",
       "became deformed, disfigured, and unsightly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Strange, but true, this process of degeneration had been going on\n",
       "in the character of Mr. Lambert, until, at the time we first knew\n",
       "him, there was only one trait left of his original nature. This was\n",
       "a peculiar, unquenchable tenderness of feeling toward the poor and\n",
       "distressed. Suspicious as he had become of all around him,\n",
       "ever toward the very ones he was trying to save from their own\n",

       "Divine Master. In this she was mistaken. In his inmost soul\n",
       "Mr. Lambert accused God of having dealt hardly with him, more hardly\n",
       "than he deserved. He had been wounded in the house of his friends.\n",
       "When his heart had been most vulnerable, there it had been pierced.\n",
       "He had never forgiven nor forgotten the blow. Sometimes, when the\n",
       "recollection of all he had been made to suffer came upon him,\n",
       "he hated himself that he did not revenge himself on all mankind.\n",
       "\"I owe no man anything,\" was one of his favorite mottoes; but after\n",
       "he became acquainted with Marion Howard he did not take much comfort\n",
       "from it. How closely after their first meeting he had watched her!\n",
       "How he longed to find her halting! But no, her motions were too\n",
       "transparent. She had genuine love to God as her Father, to Christ\n",
       "as her Saviour, and it was from this love her kindness to all around\n",
       "her sprang. This he had been forced to acknowledge when analyzing\n",
       "her character. It unsettled him and made him more irritable.\n",
       "Sometimes, when he found himself softened under her influence,\n",
       "he would recall all the injuries heaped on him,—injuries that\n",
       "had blasted his happiness forever.\n",
       "\n",
       "In his early days he had been a ripe scholar, a graduate from one\n",

       "on the subject of Christianity. He had read in the Old and New\n",
       "Testaments, but his heart remained cold in the midst of sacred fire.\n",
       "\n",
       "At times in his life he had taken pleasure in railing and ranting\n",
       "against everything sacred. In connection with the holiest Bible\n",
       "teachings he had used the words \"bigotry\" and \"humbuggery\" and\n",
       "\"cant,\" till he almost convinced himself that what he said was true.\n",
       "Almost, but not quite. There was still a spark of truth left in him,\n",
       "if only it could be ignited. He had been thinking of these questions\n",
       "when he called on Marion and asked whether she believed in churches,\n",
       "dogmas, etc. Her words, the earnestness, the assurance she expressed\n",
       "that the Gospel of Christ was indeed good news to men, that in order\n",
       "to live a good life we must believe on Him and follow His example,\n",
       "came home to his heart. He could not shake off the fear that he had\n",
       "been mistaken. He lost his sleep, and at last became so nervous and\n",
       "unsettled, so irritable and unmanageable, that his valet insisted\n",
       "he should summon a physician.\n",
       "\n",
       "This was his state when Marion came to his bedside. After she left\n",
       "he called for pen and ink, and wrote out, as well as he could recall\n",
       "it, every word of her prayer. This he put in his pocketbook and read\n",
       "over many times in a day, never without tears. The gracious\n",

       "of love, charity, and good-will, and found she answered to them all.\n",
       "Yes, her life was a good one, even judged from his standpoint.\n",
       "She did not act from a desire for the praise of men, but from\n",
       "a genuine love to Christ, and a desire, in her humble manner, to do\n",
       "good to those around her. Her note found his heart more tender than\n",
       "it had been for years, more amenable to good influences. He was not\n",
       "likely to refuse any request she might make, even to the half of his\n",

       "herself oppressed with such debility and general lassitude\n",
       "as disinclined her for any exertion. But Sunday was one of her\n",
       "busiest days. She had a Bible class in the morning with her own\n",
       "servants and those living with Mrs Mitchell, church at eleven, and\n",
       "her mission school in the afternoon, to which she usually devoted\n",
       "two hours. Then church in the evening. Mr and Mrs. Mitchell being\n",

       "could see the crippled boy seated in his wheeled chair, in front of\n",
       "group of wondering children. His back was toward the door, but the\n",
       "spectator could easily imagine the expression of fervor there would\n",

       "One was good and one was bad. I guess it was the youngest that\n",
       "was bad. He didn't like to work. The other helped his father on the\n",
       "big farm. Teacher said he thought the good one went around and told\n",
       "the servants what to do, and was not afraid to work himself. They had\n",
       "cows and calves and sheep, and all kinds of animals, I guess.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"By and by the lazy one said he was tired of staying at home.\n",
       "He wanted to travel, and he asked his father to give him his part of\n",
       "the money and let him go. His father said yes. So the father and\n",
       "the good son went on together for a great many years. They were\n",
       "pretty happy, but not very. Can you guess why?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Maybe the father was a sorrering for the boy who had quit his home,\"\n",

       "P'r'aps he didn't know where to send the letter. But now I'm going\n",
       "to tell you about the bad son. He had a whole bagful of money, and he\n",
       "thought it would last him forever. So he kept buying things and\n",
       "spending his money till one day he put his hand in his bag and it was\n",
       "all gone, every bit. He was hungry, but he had not a penny to buy\n",
       "food. He didn't dare to kneel down, as we do, and say, 'Our Father,\n",
       "give us this day our daily bread,' because he had been awfully\n",
       "wicked, getting drunk and lying and swearing, and doing everything\n",
       "bad. You can't guess, any of you, what he did at last. Why, he was\n",
       "that hungry he had to hire out to a farmer who kept pigs, and he\n",
       "watched his chance when nobody was looking, to steal some of the\n",
       "pigs' food. Before this he used to wear gay clothes, now he was all\n",
       "in rags. One day he sat down on a stump of a tree. He was awful\n",
       "homesick. He was tired of being so bad. He thought about his old\n",
       "home, and how kind his father used to be, and what good things he had\n",
       "to eat, He remembered how the men working on the farm had enough\n",
       "to eat. All at once he began to cry, 'I wish I was home. I'm awfully\n",
       "lonely way off here, and nobody speaks a kind word to me.\n",
       "Nobody gives me even the pigs' food. I'm ragged, too, and filthy.\n",
       "Oh, what a fool I was to leave my dear old home!'\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He cried and sobbed, but nobody pitied him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Say, Neddy, did he die among the pigs?\" asked a big girl, putting a\n",
       "finger in her eye to keep the tears back.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I'm coming to the good part now. After he'd been crying a good\n",
       "while, and feeling real sorry he had been so wicked, he thought\n",

       "\n",

       "the stump and started. Teacher didn't say how far it was, but at last\n",
       "he came to a place where he could see his home.  His heart beat\n",
       "dreadfully. 'Will he take me in? Will he?' Now I'm going to tell you\n",
       "the very words he told himself he would say to his father.\n",
       "Teacher made us all learn them, 'cause she said every one of us could\n",
       "say them to God, our Heavenly Father.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"'And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great\n",
       "way off, the father saw him, and had compassion unto him, and ran,\n",
       "and fell on his neck, and kissed him. And the son said unto him,\n",
       "Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am\n",
       "no more worthy to be called thy son.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"'But the father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and\n",
       "put it on him, and put ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet.\n",
       "And bring hither the fatted calf, and kill it; and let us eat, and be\n",
       "merry: for this my son was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and\n",

       "\n",

       "\"There's only one thing more,\" added Neddy, when the astonishment had\n",
       "somewhat subsided. \"Teacher said that the good father in the story\n",

       "of astonishment.\n",

       "\"Mr. Lambert, you must be calm. She does not deserve such bitter\n",

       "the penalty for his crimes. Mr Douglass forbade all mention of his\n",
       "name, and frequently alluded to his daughter as his only child.\n",
       "It was this wicked, daring fellow who suddenly appeared to my friend,\n",
       "and almost drove her wild by demanding money or jewels from her.\n",
       "She agreed to see him once, and give him all she could raise,\n",
       "on condition he would never cross her path again. She did see him.\n",
       "He seized her and held her forcibly while he wrested from her finger\n",
       "the valuable ring you had given her. His cruelty nearly cost her\n",

       "the truth at whatever cost, even her father's displeasure, it was\n",
       "impossible for her to carry out. Before she was well enough\n",
       "to understand what had passed, her husband, deceived and betrayed\n",
       "by a servant, who with tears and groans confessed her guilt, was a\n",
       "witness to the meeting between herself and her brother. He believed\n",
       "her lost to him and to virtue. He himself carried her in his arms\n",
       "to her couch, when, overcome by her brother's cruelty, she fainted,\n",

       "and comfort to this poor man. At last, recalling his request,\n",
       "she fell on her knees, and in a low tone offered up her petitions\n",
       "in his behalf.\n",

       "When she rose to her feet, she was startled at the awful pallor which\n",

       "and soon after he sank into slumber.\n",

       "of his character eccentricities and all, and has already gained such\n",
       "an influence over him that his eye turns naturally toward her\n",

       "in reality was his child.  He watched her stealthily, blushing like a\n",
       "boy when caught doing so. On the subject of her husband he was\n",
       "at first reticent. It was, however, the occasion of reviving his old\n",

       "whose gift the chimes have been, are gathering together\n",
       "from all quarters of the town to practise with their teachers\n",
       "the Christmas carols they are to sing.\n",
       "\n",
       "This is the first service in the beautiful new church. It is\n",
       "to be publicly dedicated to the worship of God on the next Sabbath,\n",
       "but for weeks the workmen have put forth all their energies\n",
       "to have it ready for a service on Christmas day. The choir have been\n",
       "practising, too; and it is rumored new organist is expected, although\n",
       "his engagement does not commence till the first of January.\n",
       "\n",
       "The sleigh-bells jingle merrily, for the ground is covered with snow.\n",
       "Even now, an hour before service, several stalls in the neat row\n",
       "of horse-sheds are occupied. Now here comes Farmer Rand, smiling and\n",
       "nodding, and shouting his Christmas salutations to young and old,\n",
       "as he drives his old horse up the ascent, through the gate close to\n",
       "the nicely shovelled flagged walk to the front. The good farmer has a\n",
       "precious load to-day, and he is very careful of it. Yes, that is\n",
       "Lucy, his old woman, so wrapped up in shawls and buffalo-robes—\n",
       "with a hot brick in her great yellow muff, and another at her feet,\n",
       "which just now are cased in a pair of her husband's blue socks—\n",
       "that she finds it almost impossible to alight from the sleigh.\n",
       "\n",
       "For weeks the good woman has been nursing her strength for this great\n",
       "and joyful occasion. For days she and her man have watched the signs\n",

       "be so propitious as to make it safe for her to go up to the house\n",
       "of the Lord and join with His people in their anthems of praise\n",
       "to the new-born King.\n",
       "\n",
       "Fortunately the sexton has recognized the farmer, and runs quickly\n",
       "to offer his services it helping her to the porch. One and another\n",
       "come forward to greet her and express their pleasure at seeing her\n",
       "here. The children, even, gather round her pew and say,—\n",

       "Yes, on this natal day of the world's Redeemer every face looks\n",

       "The service is to commence at eleven. The hand on the new and elegant\n",

       "the children have finished their practising and gone quietly\n",
       "to their seats at one end of the organ loft. The slips are all full.\n",
       "There is a hush. There comes the pastor and his bride, not a\n",
       "stranger, but known and loved by all. Pausing for an instant to show\n",
       "her into the pew, the first one selected in the house, he passes on\n",
       "up the aisle into the study at the side of the pulpit. Ethel, the\n",
       "only other occupant of the slip, causes a smile by her obsequious\n",
       "attentions to the bride. She takes a hymn-book from the rack, and,\n",
       "though unable to read a word, opens it and passes it, gets as near\n",

       "to be exempt from them. The plan from the first had been to have\n",
       "the wedding the week before Christmas, and a reception or\n",
       "housewarming at Ingleside the following Monday. But, from one cause\n",
       "and another, the new house was not finished, and this plan had to\n",
       "be postponed.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was Marion's preference to defer the wedding till such time as\n",
       "the house was considered fit for occupation. Such a pressure was,\n",
       "however, brought to bear on her, that she yielded to the wishes\n",
       "of her friend. He brought so many arguments to prove that the plan\n",
       "he now proposed was even better than the original one, that the\n",
       "few weeks before entering on the duties of housekeeping would give\n",
       "her just the leisure necessary for the formation of some of their\n",
       "new plans, etc., that, with a hearty laugh, she replied,—\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I see that you intend to have your way, and as I believe that God\n",
       "intended the husband to be the head of the family, I suppose I may\n",

       "every reason to suppose was cherishing as toward her brother\n",
       "such anger in her heart as would cut her off from Divine forgiveness.\n",
       "He was, or felt himself to be, alone in the world. He had no right\n",
       "to form a tie which would make another the sharer of such a burden\n",
       "as his. To be sure, he had brooded over that one scene in his past\n",
       "life until he had become morbid, and perhaps had not relief come\n",
       "to him he might have become unfit to preach the gospel of glad\n",
       "tidings to his fellow-men. When he walked, his eyes were cast down\n",
       "to the ground, while sighs were much more frequent with him\n",
       "than smiles.\n",
       "\n",
       "Now how different. He walked erect, with elastic tread, his eyes met\n",
       "yours with a frank smile.  One could scarcely be with him\n",
       "five minutes without being drawn to him by a certain magnetism.\n",
       "You felt that his heart was at rest, and more, you could not fail\n",
       "to be sure that he was grateful for God's goodness, that he\n",
       "was literally obeying the Divine injunction, \"Rejoice in the Lord\n",
       "alway, and again, I say, rejoice.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "1.  It is true that nothing was said of responsibility in Mr. Motley's\n",

       "at the time it was made have been contested and are not admitted.\"  It\n",
       "follows beyond dispute that Great Britain may in this particular case\n",
       "have incurred grave responsibilities; in fact, the whole negotiations\n",
       "implied as much.  Perhaps Mr. Motley need not have used the word\n",

       "Write a formal, historical narrative paragraph in a literary style, capturing the tone of a 19th-century biography. The paragraph should describe a prominent figure’s relocation and intellectual pursuits during a specific period, transitioning from a focus on scholarly work to the pressing concerns of their homeland. Begin by mentioning the figure’s residence during a particular winter, followed by their move to a prestigious address in a major city. Highlight their recent publication of a significant historical work and their readiness to continue this scholarly endeavor. Then, shift to the interruption caused by the emergence of a major civil conflict in their native country, which draws their attention away from historical research to contemporary events. Use sophisticated vocabulary and complex sentence structures, maintaining a serious and reflective tone. Avoid modern phrasing or casual language, and ensure the paragraph conveys a sense of historical gravitas and intellectual depth. Aim for a length of 4-5 sentences, with each sentence moderately detailed and flowing naturally into the next."

       "\n",
       "While the Flowerpot was thus receiving fond good-byes, EDWIN DROOD, on\n",
       "his way to see her, suffered an indecision of purpose which might have\n",
       "bred disquiet in a more gigantic mind than his. With the package\n",
       "containing the memorial stay-lace in one pocket, and his hands in two\n",
       "others, he strode up the Bumsteadville turnpike in a light overcoat and\n",
       "a brown study. But for good Mr. DIBBLE'S undeniably truthful picture of\n",
       "a modern lover's actual situation, he might have allowed matters to go\n",
       "as they would, and sunk into an early marriage without one prayer to\n",
       "Heaven for mercy. Now, however, that picture troubled him even more than\n",
       "the bump which he had got upon his head from the tilting table in the\n",
       "lawyer's office, and he was disposed to send the stay-lace back to the\n",
       "candid old man. \"FLORA and I have about equal intellects,\" reasoned he\n",
       "to himself. \"Shall I leave the whole question to her, or my own\n",
       "decision! One would be about as profound in wisdom as the other. Which?\n",
       "I guess I'll toss-up for it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He stepped aside from the road, under a leafless tree, and drew from a\n",
       "pocket a badly speckled nickel coin. \"Heads for her, tails for me,\" he\n",
       "said, with some awe in his tone. The tasteful coin was tossed, and\n",
       "\"Heads\" stared up at him from the frozen ground. \"It's her inning,\" he\n",
       "muttered, and, re-pocketing the money and his hands, went on whistling.\n",
       "Thus the great crises of our laborious human lives are settled by the\n",
       "idle inspiration of a moment, and fate, for good, or evil, comes as it\n",
       "is cent.\n",
       "\n",
       "The Flowerpot, expecting him, was ready in her walking dress, and, by\n",
       "tacit permission of Miss CAROWTHERS, the two started upon a promenade\n",
       "for the nearest confidential cross-road, each eating half of an apple\n",
       "which Mr. DROOD had brought to disguise his feelings.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear, absurd EDDY,\" said FLORA, when they had arrived in a secluded\n",
       "lane not far from St. Cow's Church, \"I want to give you something very\n",
       "serious, and oh! I'm so ridiculously nervous about doing so,--especially\n",
       "after your giving me this apple.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Never mind the apple, FLORA. It was the fruit of our First Parents, and\n",

       "allow it to fetter your freedom of speech, and please try to eat it\n",
       "without such a gashing noise.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Thank you, EDDY. You have always been liberal with me. And now are you\n",
       "sure you won't be absurdly angry with me if I give you something?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He fell away from her a moment, as half anticipating a kiss, but\n",
       "promised that he would restrain his temper.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then here you are, EDDY;\" and she drew from a pocket in her dress and\n",
       "held out to him a small worsted mitten.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You give this to me?\" he said, accepting it, and tossing it from one\n",
       "hand to the other, as though it were something hot.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, dear, ridiculous friend; and from this day forth let us give up\n",

       "\"Never get married?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not to each other.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Under the ecstatic influence of the moment, the emancipated young\n",
       "bondman began dancing and turning somersaults like one possessed but,\n",
       "quickly remembering himself, hastened to regain a perpendicular position\n",
       "at her side, and coughed energetically, as though, the recent gymnastics\n",
       "had been prescribed for his cold.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My own sister!\" he exclaimed, \"a weight is now lifted from both of our\n",
       "minds, and both of us should be the better for the lifting-cure It is\n",
       "noble in you to let me off so.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And it's perfectly splendid in you, EDDY, to make no horrid fuss about\n",
       "it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The beautiful contest of generosities between these two young souls made\n",
       "each as tender toward the other as though the parents of both had been\n",
       "alive and frantically opposed to their mutual attachment.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We are both sorry that we have ever had any absurd engagement between\n",
       "us,\" said FLORA, with a manner of exquisite softness, \"and now, that we\n",
       "are like brother and sister, we need not be all the time playing the\n",
       "Pretty with each other, and needn't be putting on our best things every\n",
       "time we have to meet. You think that my hair always curls in this way,\n",
       "don't you, EDDY?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why, you don't mean to say, FLORA, that it's _all_--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"--False? No, you absurd thing! But curling irons, and oil, and crimping\n",
       "pins have to be used hours and hours.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ha! ha!\" laughed EDWIN DROOD, \"I see the point; you've had to make-up\n",
       "for me. Now I dare say that you have thought my boots, which I have worn\n",
       "in your company, were the right size for me? They're really one and a\n",
       "half sizes too small, and almost kill me. As for gloves, I never wear\n",
       "any at all except when I come to see you.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh, I know all about that, darling sister. I couldn't find any fault\n",

       "rich-looking, was only plated.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The little creature burst into a laugh of delight, and pressed his arm\n",
       "with sisterly enthusiasm. \"And we can be perfectly honest with each\n",
       "other; can't we, EDDY? As a partnership for life until death should us\n",

       "\n",
       "\"No,\" answered the equally happy young man; \"as we're not trying to\n",

       "\"No sir, not one, and I can find no sign of the Triassic period.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "Yo Semite, and gilding the tops of the big trees in the Mariposa valley.\n",
       "\n",
       "After feasting his eyes on this magnificent prospect, Mr. P. came\n",
       "down-stairs to feast on something which owed its enchantment to a\n",
       "cooking-range, and not to a range of distance. He met the Professor at\n",
       "the bottom of the stairs, and hastened to pacify him by inquiries about\n",
       "some little bushes that he had just gathered.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is laurel,\" said the learned man, grumly.\n",

       "\"Lard?\" cried the Professor. \"I never heard of such a thing.\"\n",

       "The next day Mr. P. made the ascent of High Peak. Everybody does that;\n",
       "and so, with a small party, Mr. P. started out--gaily enough. On\n",
       "reaching the place where the heavy climbing begins, they met the New\n",
       "York Fat Men's Club coming down, and the peculiar appearance of the\n",
       "members deterred most of Mr. P.'s party from attempting the great feat.\n",
       "It was proposed that Mr. P. alone should make the ascent. He\n",
       "assented--and being thus, in a manner, ordered up--went it alone.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was not an easy thing--that climbing of High Peak--as any one will be\n",
       "apt to conclude after attentively studying this picture of the ascent.\n",
       "But an indomitable will can conquer all obstacles that are not too much\n",
       "for it, and at last Mr. P. balanced himself on the extreme point of the\n",
       "Peak. The view was so glorious that he instantly hastened down to inform\n",
       "his companions that they too must not miss it upon any account. Several\n",
       "of them, JOHN BINGHAM, of Ohio; SIMON CAMERON, and HENRY WILSON, of\n",
       "Massachusetts, objected very strongly to the proposed climb, as they\n",
       "were never in the habit of occupying very high ground. But Mr. P.\n",
       "insisted that they would there obtain what they needed more than\n",
       "anything else in the world, and he begged their pardon if he referred to\n",
       "extended views. So at last they all went up, and when they reached the\n",
       "topmost point Mr. P. placed himself so as to cut off his companions'\n",
       "retreat, and then he delivered to them a discourse that they will not\n",
       "soon forget.\n",
       "\n",
       "When from his remarks, and the practical illustration which lay beneath\n",
       "them, they had been made aware that it was a great country of varied\n",

       "in a wagon. The scene was sublime. At one place he came across a bevy of\n",

       "might suppose, a contraction of the name of a political party in this\n",
       "country that at present enjoys the Lion's share of the spoils. It is\n",
       "true that some of the American Rads are immense brutes, but in other\n",
       "respects they do not bear much resemblance to the \"lord with a big head\"\n",
       "which infests the African and Asiatic continents. Much has been said of\n",
       "the pluck and endurance of the Lion, but his heart often fails him in\n",
       "the hour of danger, and he sometimes Caves in without showing as much\n",
       "Bottom as is displayed by his counterfeit presentment on the stage. In\n",
       "short, like the Noble Savage of our own wilds, his moral attributes have\n",
       "been greatly exaggerated. He prowls through the woods at night in search\n",
       "of the herbivora which constitute his prey, but generally vanishes at\n",
       "the appearance of Aurora. The Rad also makes tremendous havoc among the\n",
       "stock in many parts of the East, but has never been known to molest the\n",

       "short range air-gun at the distance of three thousand miles. For a\n",
       "moment the shaggy monster looked angrily across the Main at\n",

       "whereupon he yawned, winked lazily at an adjacent Unicorn, and relapsed\n",

Use sophisticated vocabulary and formal phrasing, such as \"comprehensive analysis,\" \"thoughtful presentation,\" and \"significant contribution.\" Structure the paragraph as a series of concise, declarative sentences, each attributed to a different academic figure, with their titles and institutions clearly stated. Ensure the sentences are varied in length but maintain a polished and cohesive flow. Avoid direct repetition of ideas, but emphasize the work’s intellectual merit, clarity, and relevance.

       "moreover, by advancing age. The explosion acting on such a\n",

The narrative should describe a perilous and swift flight, focusing on the immediate urgency of the situation. Include a character who is gradually outpacing the narrator due to being made of lighter material, leading to a poignant farewell. The narrator should observe the character’s ascent in detail, noting the progression from head to feet, and express a tender, bittersweet moment of parting, such as a kiss on the foot. The farewell should be mutual, with the character murmuring a soft goodbye before disappearing into the night, leaving the narrator with a sense of finality and loss. Use descriptive, elevated vocabulary and complex sentence structures to convey the emotional weight and dramatic nature of the scene. Employ literary devices like imagery and subtle symbolism to enhance the narrative. The paragraph should be of moderate length, with a balance of longer, flowing sentences and shorter, impactful ones to maintain rhythm and tension. Capture the essence of a fleeting, tragic moment with a sense of inevitability and quiet sorrow."
