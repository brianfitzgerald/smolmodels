      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

      "released with an effort that ended in a sob of hysteria and fear.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The route Pierre took upon these nights was always the same. With\n",
      "his long black opera cape and moth-eaten topper, he stalked through\n",
      "the streets like some villain from an old Drury Lane melodrama. \"A\n",

      "remark, if they did not see his face. Pierre gave no heed to the few\n",
      "people he passed, except to draw the cape quickly about his face if\n",
      "they approached him too near under the eery, fog-filtered glare of the\n",
      "street lamps.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "At Nigh Street, Pierre's bent figure paused wearily before he started\n",
      "up the hill. A few yards from the corner, he paused again, staring\n",
      "at the yellow lines of light cutting the fog and issuing from the\n",
      "slit-like windows of the beautiful home of the Countess Donella\n",
      "Moonard. In the thick mists, the house, impressively large and of\n",
      "Egyptian architecture, resembled a temple of Black Magic veiled in\n",
      "oppressive incense. The yellow slits glowered steadily and ominously.\n",
      "What brilliance and exotic color lay within!\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

      "come from the most ancient tombs along the Blue Nile.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

      "an outcast from the very society that now applauded the brilliant\n",

      "felt! For weeks he had not been outside his home. His lungs cried\n",
      "out in rebellion, cried greedily for deeper and deeper drafts of the\n",
      "refreshing breath of night. The Countess Moonard! His hatred flamed\n",
      "higher. Her guests ... fools! What would happen if he were to walk into\n",
      "that gay party scene, drop his cape from about his face, and tell them\n",
      "that----\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Suddenly he paused; the pale, frightened face of a beautiful girl was\n",
      "confronting him in the dim flare of the gas torch. It was too late to\n",
      "draw the folds of his cape about his face. The girl had already seen\n",
      "the sickening sight, and a stifled cry rose from her lovely throat.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Oh, Carl!\" she stammered weakly, clutching the shoulder of the tall,\n",
      "handsome young man who stood beside her.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Usually when Pierre saw that he had frightened someone with the sight\n",
      "of his horrible features, he turned and ran away, rather than suffer\n",
      "the indignity of an apology--but something about this girl made him\n",
      "linger. It was a small diamond-studded pendant that hung from about\n",
      "her slim white throat. In that, Pierre saw the unmistakable sign of\n",
      "death and despair that always cast its shadow upon the throats of the\n",
      "Countess Moonard's victims. The girl was marked!\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "From the girl's face, Pierre turned to the young man. He looked into\n",
      "his eyes and saw there the familiar terror that always spread across\n",
      "the faces of those who looked upon him.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A long moment of silence passed. The girl turned from him, covering\n",
      "her face with her hands and clinging tightly to the young man, who now\n",
      "stared at Pierre with growing inquisitiveness.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The young man tried to look pleasant. He was an intelligent young\n",

      "regaining his poise.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, of course!\" Carl spoke with more assurance now. The girl on\n",
      "his arm was still trembling. Neither Carl nor the girl wore wraps; they\n",
      "had been wandering through the gardens of the Countess Moonard's estate\n",
      "in preference to dancing.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Ruth, dearest, don't allow this to affect you.\" He patted her shoulder\n",
      "gently. \"I say, old man, you gave her an awful fright. I don't wish to\n",
      "be unkind, but you really are enough to frighten anyone.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Indeed? It is rather difficult to see here in this poor light, but\n",
      "something should be done about your face. As a plastic surgeon, I would\n",
      "recommend that you----\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Permit an operation?\" Pierre interrupted. \"Young man, modern surgery\n",
      "cannot do anything for my case.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"I disagree with you. Surely you would be willing to give me a chance?\n",
      "This must be horrible, going about frightening people. Or do you enjoy\n",
      "nearly scaring young women to death? My fiancée is still trembling!\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl removed a handkerchief from his pocket. \"Here, Ruth, stop crying,\n",
      "and use this. The boogy man isn't going to get you. What am I going to\n",
      "marry anyway, a cry-baby?\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"I'm not crying!\" she protested indignantly. \"It was just the sudden\n",
      "shock of--well, you and I walking along, and then suddenly to----\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Oh, no, no; it is I who should apologize.\" Pierre's voice trembled\n",
      "with gratitude. \"You are very kind--both of you. I was quite careless\n",
      "tonight. Usually I am more thoughtful of people. You see it is not\n",
      "pleasant to----\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "He was looking at her throat. If this young man would listen! But\n",
      "no, it was impossible. No one would believe the story of the diamond\n",
      "pendant.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pierre said stiffly: \"I really thank you for your kindness, and I am\n",
      "sorry if I have spoiled your evening. Good night!\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Oh, but wait a minute,\" Carl called to him. \"I really meant what I\n",
      "said about your face. I think I can do something for you. Won't you\n",
      "take my card and call at my office? At least you can tell me what\n",
      "caused this awful affliction.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pierre quietly accepted the card that was handed to him. He thrust it\n",
      "quickly into the pocket of his vest. Doctor Fielding noticed that the\n",
      "man's hands were as hideous as his face.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"You think you would like to know what afflicted me?\" Pierre said with\n",
      "a trace of bitterness. \"I wonder if you would believe me if I told you.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pierre waited a moment before he said abruptly: \"I see you have been to\n",
      "the Countess Moonard's party. Do you know her well?\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"As well as most people know the mysterious Countess Donella Moonard,\"\n",
      "Carl laughed. \"Does anyone really know her? Surely you are not\n",
      "acquainted with the Countess?\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pierre did not answer his question, but said directly: \"Young man, I\n",
      "will accept the invitation to call at your office. I never go about in\n",
      "the daylight, but if you would be there sometime in the----\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Very well, but I do not come because I think that you can do anything\n",
      "for me.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pierre added significantly: \"Perhaps I may be able to help _you_. If\n",
      "there are no stars or moonlight, I will call on you.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"I don't understand. What does the absence of stars and moonlight have\n",
      "to do with your calling on me?\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"I will explain that later. If I may offer a word of advice to the\n",
      "young lady, I am sure I might save both of you from----\" Pierre\n",
      "faltered. So much to explain, so much that was unexplainable! How\n",
      "could he hope that these two young people would believe him?\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"You have made a foolish bargain with someone. The price you will pay\n",
      "is too high. But it grows late, and I am sure there is little I can say\n",
      "to you just now. Perhaps I have said too much already. Until we meet\n",
      "again, I bid you good evening!\" Pierre removed his hat, and bowed in a\n",
      "low sweeping movement.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Ruth could not restrain her gasp of horror as she saw the man's head.\n",
      "It was scarred and smelled strongly of burning hair. He had forgotten\n",
      "that he should not remove his hat. Mumbling an embarrassed apology,\n",
      "Pierre hurried into the darkness beyond the gate.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Carl, did you see his hair? The man looked as if he had been horribly\n",
      "burned!\" Ruth cried when he was gone.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"The most awful-looking man I have ever seen. All your fault too; you\n",
      "would insist on walking in the night air. Why did we have to walk all\n",
      "the way around the garden? The Countess' parties always do this to you,\n",
      "Ruth. They give you the craziest ideas.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Then you do remember what she prophesied tonight!\" Ruth exclaimed.\n",
      "\"Really, isn't it uncanny? Tonight the Countess told me that I would\n",
      "take a new step in my life; something would happen that would change\n",
      "everything for me. She said it would begin with a horrible fright. And\n",
      "I was frightened, Carl. Do you suppose----\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Suppose nothing!\" Carl replied with some exasperation. \"The Countess\n",
      "and her fake prophecies are without weight to me. You women are always\n",
      "falling for the ways of some old crone with a crystal or a deck of\n",
      "cards in her hand. Besides, she may have planted that old man in our\n",
      "path tonight just to make her claims more convincing. How do we know\n",
      "but that all of that horrible appearance was not just so much clever\n",
      "make-up?\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"I just do, Carl.\" She smiled at him. \"I believe everything the\n",

      "party.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Ruth, I wish you would give up your devotion to the Countess and her\n",
      "mad religion, or whatever it is. I don't like it. You've changed since\n",
      "you have taken her so seriously. First thing I know you'll be a convert\n",
      "to her--oh, what do you call it--moon worship?\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "She stopped and turned to him; her voice was strange and final in its\n",
      "tone. \"Carl, I am already a convert. The religion of Moonere has given\n",
      "me everything I want in life. Soon I will take the sacred vows of its\n",
      "followers.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"You can't. I won't have it, I tell you. Oh, Ruth, surely you can't\n",
      "believe in this preposterous, this unnatural faith? I don't know what\n",
      "hellish power the Countess may have over you; but I do know that it\n",
      "isn't natural for a normal girl, reared as you have been, suddenly to\n",

      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl was interrupted by the unheralded appearance of one of the\n",
      "Countess Moonard's swarthy-skinned Egyptian servants. The man, tall and\n",
      "sinisterly handsome, was dressed like all the Countess' menials; he\n",
      "wore the brief, exotic attire of a slave in an ancient court or temple.\n",
      "The servant bowed his head and made a peculiar sign which Ruth seemed\n",
      "to understand.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"The Countess desires to see you, most lovely maiden of the Temple of\n",
      "Moonere,\" the servant said solemnly.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Maiden of the temple of Moonere!\" Carl could not restrain his disgust.\n",
      "\"You tell your mistress I am taking Ruth home; and that if she wants to\n",
      "see anyone about her insane religion, she may consult me.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The servant did not answer him, but his eyes narrowed into slits of\n",
      "cruelty and hatred. His lips curled contemptuously.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Nilathar, I will follow you to the priestess,\" Ruth said, ignoring\n",
      "Carl's threat to take her home.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Ruth!\" Carl pulled her to his side. \"I'm not going to let you stay\n",
      "here alone. You've got to listen to me.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"No one is to restrain a maiden of the temple when the priestess\n",
      "calls,\" he said, standing between Ruth and Carl.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Why, you----\" Carl lunged at the Egyptian, who quickly drew a knife.\n",
      "The blade pressed against Carl's vest, and seemed only too eager to\n",
      "press further. The servant smiled in mock courtesy.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"The guests are departing. The Countess sends you her regrets, for she\n",
      "is retiring with her faithful maidens,\" the servant said coldly. \"Your\n",
      "coat and hat will be brought to you.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl was furious, but a length of glittering steel in obviously adept\n",
      "and determined hands is a deterrent to the most courageous, and will\n",
      "instill restraint and judgment in the most foolhardy. What perplexed\n",
      "Carl also left him with a feeling of helplessness--Ruth's apparent\n",
      "lack of consideration of his danger. This was not like the girl he had\n",
      "known since his early childhood; the girl who would have fought like\n",
      "a tigress anyone who might have threatened Carl. Now she ignored him\n",
      "entirely, as if it meant nothing to her that his encounter with the\n",
      "servant might have proved fatal for him. He turned to make one final\n",
      "plea to Ruth. She was gone.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "When his coat and hat were brought to him, he took them and said\n",
      "with an ironic smile, \"Tell the Countess I am overwhelmed with her\n",
      "hospitality. She must call on me some day.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Beneath the surface of Carl's polite departure swirled an undercurrent\n",
      "of bewildered resentment. There was nothing natural about Ruth's\n",
      "acceptance of the faith of Moonerism, whatever that was. Carl's\n",
      "thoughts of the entire evening moved rapidly back to the hideous old\n",
      "man they had met at the garden entrance; he recalled his words of\n",
      "advice to Ruth: \"You have made a foolish bargain with someone. The\n",
      "price you will pay is too high.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "That old man must have sensed Ruth's intention to follow this strange\n",
      "religion; he knew more about the Countess Moonard than he pretended.\n",
      "But what? Nothing about the entire evening made sense. Ruth had become\n",
      "a stranger to him, a beautiful stranger. The characterization seemed\n",
      "significant, though in what way he could not fathom. Ruth had always\n",
      "been an attractive girl, but recently he had found her beauty violently\n",
      "compelling. And tonight, the strange new depths of her beauty had\n",
      "made him marvel; it was a beauty of coldness and austerity, and it\n",
      "frightened him. Ruth, the Ruth he knew, was and must be beautiful, but\n",
      "never cold, never cruelly elusive.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Something was happening to Ruth, something that was taking her away\n",
      "from him. And that was not permissible. Carl Fielding did not allow\n",
      "what he loved and wanted to be taken away from him. The Countess had\n",
      "something to do with it, and he would fight her; but he must learn\n",
      "something about her, the strange power she exercised over Ruth and the\n",
      "other converts.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl settled restlessly back into the interior of his car, musing\n",
      "over the strange events of the evening. Who might know anything about\n",
      "the Countess Moonard, other than her converts, whose lips were always\n",
      "sealed with secrecy?\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Although it was a slim hope, there was his old friend, Inspector\n",
      "Chadwick of Scotland Yard. Perhaps the eccentric detective would be\n",
      "able to assist him.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Early the next day, Inspector Chadwick looked up from his desk to\n",
      "behold the troubled features of Doctor Carl Fielding. Carl had not\n",
      "slept the night before, and his worry showed plainly on his face.\n",
      "Chadwick leaned back in his swivel-chair, and greeted him in a tone of\n",
      "mock seriousness.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"So you've come to confess? Well, turn over the jewels, and I'll see\n",
      "that they make it easy for you. I'll recommend hanging at the earliest\n",
      "possible date. How are you, Doc? Haven't seen you since last spring.\n",
      "Been intending to get around to your office for a little chat. Heard\n",
      "you were engaged to be married. And from the looks of that long face\n",
      "of yours, you must already be hitched. Sit down, put your feet on the\n",
      "desk, smoke my cigars, and I'll even go so far as to offer you a good\n",
      "drink of brandy just to show you my heart's in the right place.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "This was Chadwick's manner of treating everyone. He ran a continuous\n",
      "flow of conversation, annoying his subject with the enforced silence;\n",
      "but from this silence Chadwick often learned more than if he had\n",
      "permitted him to talk. Inspector Chadwick could see that Carl had not\n",
      "come to him for just a friendly visit.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

      "You look like a sick canary. What have you been doing to yourself? I\n",
      "always said doctors were poor advertisements for their remedies. Try\n",
      "this brandy; it might put a little color into your face. Good idea\n",
      "there! I'll play doctor, and you be the inspector for a while. If this\n",
      "Crayton case keeps up any longer, I'm going to be a first-class medico\n",
      "anyway. You know, it's one of those very technical points; all about\n",
      "this and that. Practically have to understand medicine to get any sense\n",
      "out of the thing. Should be right up your alley. How do you like my\n",
      "American speech? Notice I talk more like an American than I do a loyal\n",
      "subject of the king? Need that effect. Been working on terms, tones,\n",

      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"See here, Chadwick, will you be quiet for a minute, and let me talk?\"\n",
      "Carl finally blurted out.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Chadwick threw back his head and laughed, a hearty laugh that shook\n",
      "his broad shoulders and made his face redder than it already was. \"Oh,\n",
      "so you want to talk? Well, well, fancy that! All right, Doc; you talk,\n",
      "and I'll listen. But if it's about me being best man at your wedding,\n",
      "that's off. I don't look right in formal dress. When is the wedding, by\n",
      "the way?\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Unless I get some help, there may not be any wedding.\" Carl looked\n",
      "soberly at him.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Help?\" Chadwick laughed again. \"What do you want me to do, persuade\n",
      "the girl to marry you? I thought you had already proposed.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Chadwick, did you ever hear of a religious cult known as Moonerism?\"\n",
      "Carl ignored his friend's attempt at humor.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Yes. Ruth, the girl I'm going to marry, has suddenly been seized with\n",
      "a desire to become one of her followers. Chadwick, there's something\n",
      "uncanny about the Countess and her religion. You probably know more\n",
      "about her activities than anyone else in London. So I----\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"I'm afraid I know very little.\" Chadwick rose from his chair, and\n",
      "walked restlessly about the office. The religion of Moonerism had\n",
      "been brought to the attention of Scotland Yard once before; however,\n",
      "investigation of the Countess Moonard had only revealed that she\n",
      "believed in a religion having to do with certain astral and planetary\n",
      "bodies. Those who gave themselves up to its teachings never revealed\n",
      "the secrets; and those who tried to learn more were either converted or\n",
      "by some strange manner suddenly and for ever frightened from attempting\n",
      "to obtain further knowledge.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Surely there is something we could do about it.\" Carl began walking\n",
      "back and forth with his friend. \"You know how I feel about Ruth's\n",
      "acceptance of such a strange faith. Besides, Chadwick, I have reason to\n",
      "believe that--well----\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The words stuck in his throat. He could not bring himself to believe\n",
      "that the Countess or anyone else really had supernatural powers;\n",
      "furthermore what he was beginning to suspect was beyond belief.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Doc, there's really nothing we can do about this, except to try and\n",
      "persuade your fiancée to use better judgment. There are many strange\n",
      "religious cults in London. As long as they do not break any of our\n",
      "laws, we cannot stop them. No one has ever found out enough about\n",
      "the Countess and her beliefs to justify a thorough investigation.\n",
      "Her following is comparatively small, mostly beautiful women--very\n",
      "beautiful women.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"That's just it,\" Carl said excitedly. \"All of them are beautiful and\n",
      "young in appearance. The Countess herself--she must be seventy if she's\n",
      "a day, but look at her. Her face is ageless. Chadwick, you know that\n",
      "I would be the last person in the world to waste time over foolish\n",
      "beliefs in the supernatural; yet--well, I've noticed that Ruth has\n",
      "become--different. I see it in her face, in her actions, in----\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Of course you do. All those religions require a certain amount of\n",
      "fanatical devotion. Ruth is young and impressionable. Perhaps if you\n",
      "took her away for a while?\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"But that's just it! She seems to move as if controlled by another\n",
      "mind. Last night I was almost stabbed trying to keep her from staying\n",
      "with the Countess, and the affair left her entirely unimpressed with my\n",
      "danger.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Yes, by one of the Countess' servants. Look, Chadwick, you are clever\n",
      "at obtaining secrets. Why can't you work on this, and really find out\n",
      "what happens to those who take up Moonerism?\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"I know what happens. They follow it to their death. Apparently they\n",
      "lead normal lives outside of their activities within the temple. What\n",
      "can Scotland Yard do about that? Today people have a right to worship\n",
      "as they please, you know.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Oh, you don't grasp what I mean. I think there is something beyond\n",
      "the ordinary enchantment of a strange religious faith. Call it what\n",
      "you will, the Countess Donella Moonard has a power over the few people\n",
      "she contacts; and that power is transforming Ruth from a lovely girl\n",
      "into----\" Carl shuddered.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Come, come, Doc. You're allowing this too much importance. I will\n",
      "admit the acceptance of the religion is bad enough; but after all, I\n",
      "know of at least fifty prominent women, in good society, who believe in\n",
      "Moonerism. They are not faring so badly.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"This is Inspector Chadwick.\" He smiled at Carl. \"You say you want to\n",
      "speak to Doctor Fielding? Why, of course. He's right here in my office.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"No one knew I was here. Who----\" Carl took the phone with an\n",
      "expression of puzzled fear. \"Ruth! Yes, dearest. At once. Of course.\n",
      "Please try to control yourself. I'll be there as quickly as I can.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "He banged the receiver down, and turned to Chadwick. \"Ruth calling me.\n",
      "She's talking strangely. Said someone put your phone number in her\n",
      "mind. She wants me at once. Come with me, Chadwick. Something's wrong.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Reaching Ruth's apartment in record time, Carl was startled by the look\n",
      "of fear in her eyes. She looked as if she had just been awakened from a\n",
      "horrible nightmare, as she stood before him in her negligee; her light\n",
      "brown hair, usually so well-brushed and sleek, was now a wild mass of\n",
      "disorder.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Oh, Carl! Carl! What has happened to me? Where have I been?\" She ran\n",
      "to his arms.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Why, Ruth, don't you remember? I left you last night at the Countess\n",
      "Moonard's. You insisted upon staying.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"She said what?\" Carl took her shoulders between his hands and shook\n",
      "her anxiously. \"Ruth, what did she say?\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Ruth's eyes opened. The fear came into them again, and she began crying\n",
      "hysterically. \"Oh, it can't be! Carl, I'm lost! Lost!\" she sobbed.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl led her to a chair, into which she dropped, limp and helpless.\n",
      "Suddenly she started talking again, her eyes staring widely.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"I don't know. I don't remember what happened after I fell asleep at\n",
      "the Countess'. I should remember. I want to remember what she said\n",
      "to me, and I'm afraid now. I awoke here in my room. I heard a voice\n",
      "calling to me. There was no one here, no one with a voice like the one\n",
      "that was calling me. It's calling now! It's warning me, Carl, warning\n",
      "me not to go on. Listen! I can hear it so plainly. It's a voice--a\n",
      "voice like that old man's. The old man with the horrible face, and\n",
      "eyes, and--oh, Carl, Carl, what did I do? Now there are two voices. The\n",
      "Countess is telling me to come back--to sleep, to sleep. And that old\n",
      "man is saying: 'Don't listen to her; listen to me. I am your master.\n",
      "Moonere will take your soul to a hell beyond hell!'\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"There's nothing I can do for her now, except to quiet her,\" Carl said\n",
      "finally. \"She needs sleep. A sedative, and perhaps we can get her mind\n",
      "back to normal.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Under Carl's care, Ruth was soon asleep; although her body convulsed\n",
      "with sudden spasms of fear that came even through her slumber, as if\n",
      "she were defending herself from unseen demons who were dragging her\n",
      "away. Gently closing the door of her bedroom, he returned to talk with\n",
      "Chadwick.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "While Carl had been inducing her to sleep, Chadwick had discovered a\n",
      "small necklace upon the carpet. It looked as if it had been torn from\n",
      "someone's throat with great violence.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Why, yes. Ruth was wearing it last night. It is something new she\n",
      "picked up.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"No, nothing new about this.\" Chadwick shook his head. \"This is the\n",
      "symbol of Moonerism. I've seen them before. Never this close, however.\n",
      "Notice the pendant?\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "For the first time, Carl observed the pendant closely. It was oval,\n",
      "about two inches and a half long, about an inch and a half wide, and\n",
      "apparently of some onyx-like substance. It glowed with an unearthly,\n",
      "blue-black light, faint but perceptible. At the upper side, and a\n",
      "little to the right, a small glittering stone was set; a stone that\n",
      "glowed as if it were imbued with some cruel, radiant life. From this\n",
      "stone, a thin line of light traced downward to the lower center of the\n",
      "oval, where another and larger stone was set. When the thin line of\n",
      "light reached this second sphere, it grew brighter and engulfed it in a\n",
      "consuming glow.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Wonder what that design means?\" Chadwick took the necklace back again.\n",
      "\"You know, Doc, it looks to me as if the Countess Moonard is going to\n",
      "be thoroughly investigated this time. As soon as Ruth awakens, we must\n",
      "try to get more information from her. No doubt she was hypnotized. But\n",
      "this old man she speaks of----\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"I know who she means. I'll tell you about him; but first, I want to\n",
      "take another look at her. I think I had better get a nurse, and----\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl was moving to the bedroom as he spoke. When he opened the door, he\n",
      "let out a cry: \"She's gone!\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A hasty search of the room and the adjoining bath revealed nothing. The\n",
      "open window with the curtains blowing lazily was their only clue.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Kidnapped!\" whistled Chadwick. \"Now this _is_ a case for Scotland\n",
      "Yard. Come on; we're going to pay a visit to the Countess.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The voice Carl heard over the telephone made his face suddenly pale.\n",
      "It was the voice of Pierre Soret, saying: \"Doctor Fielding, you must\n",
      "trust the fate of your fiancée to me. She is being taken back to the\n",
      "Temple of Moonere, but do not permit any rash blunders by the police to\n",
      "interfere. Her life will pay the penalty. I am your friend. Wait until\n",
      "tonight, and I will come to your office, if the stars permit.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Doctor Fielding looked from his watch to the window of his office,\n",
      "opening upon a black velvet night. He had encountered considerable\n",
      "difficulty in restraining Inspector Chadwick from going at once to the\n",
      "Countess Moonard's home in search of Ruth. Now he was further annoyed\n",
      "by the torture of doubt. Had he been foolish in obeying the voice--the\n",
      "voice of an old man he had seen only once before? Perhaps the telephone\n",
      "call had only been a trick to delay the rescue of Ruth. That could be,\n",
      "for it was very late, and there was no sign of the old man, although\n",
      "the sky was without a twinkle of starlight.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The telephone on his desk disturbed his thoughts with its jangling\n",
      "ring. He answered impatiently; it would be Inspector Chadwick calling\n",
      "again to find out if the mysterious old man had made his appearance.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"No! We've gone this far; we must hold out. There's someone at the door\n",
      "now. It's surely he. I'll call you when he's gone,\" Carl shouted into\n",
      "the telephone, crashed the receiver on the hook, and ran to the door.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Sorry, doctor,\" she said, pushing a stray wisp of grimy hair from her\n",
      "eyes, \"but I thought if ye didn't mind, I would be cleanin' yer office.\n",
      "But then if I'll bother ye----\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Yes, you will,\" Carl answered hastily. \"Forget about my office for\n",
      "this one night. I am expecting a caller.\" He took some loose coins from\n",
      "his pocket and gave them to her. \"Here, take these and buy yourself a\n",
      "midnight snack.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl had to push her gently but firmly out of the door to shut off the\n",
      "flood of almost tearful gratitude the old woman was heaping upon him.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "He closed the door, and turned again to search the sky for any trace of\n",
      "unwelcome stars when a scream echoed down the corridor of the offices.\n",
      "Throwing open the door, he saw the old man standing in the corridor,\n",
      "his black cape covering his face. The charwoman was hastening down the\n",
      "stairs, gesticulating and screaming with fright.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl ushered him into his office, and quickly locked the door. Pierre\n",
      "now kept his cape wrapped about his face as he looked suspiciously\n",
      "about the office.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Yes. I've been waiting all evening for you. Now please tell me about\n",
      "Ruth. Is she all right? Oh, what does it all mean anyway?\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl hurried him to a chair in front of his desk, and then seated\n",
      "himself. Pierre sat down, but still remained covered.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Doctor Fielding, I am glad that you trusted my telephone call this\n",
      "afternoon,\" Pierre began to speak. \"When I told you last night that\n",
      "I would come to see you, it was because I wanted to help you. Your\n",
      "fiancée was in danger. I saw the sign of Moonere upon her throat.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Yes, that is the mark of the Countess Moonard--the beginning of what\n",
      "will eventually become this!\" Pierre stood up, throwing the cape from\n",
      "his face.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "For a moment Carl's senses reeled. He gripped the edge of his desk,\n",
      "and leaned unsteadily against the back of his chair. He felt the blood\n",
      "drain from his head; he had not felt this way since his first days in\n",
      "the dissecting-room at the medical school. His horror shamed him. After\n",
      "all, he was a doctor who was supposed to be able to stand the ghastly\n",
      "sight of blood and injury. But this was different! What he saw in\n",
      "Pierre's face was beyond ordinary gore!\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The face seemed to be afire. It looked like flesh that was slowly being\n",
      "cooked. The eyes bulged and smoke seemed to swirl from them. And above\n",
      "it all there was the horrible stench of charred human skin.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "For a long moment Pierre said nothing. Carl could not speak, although\n",
      "he fought bravely to gain control of his feelings.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"I--I can't believe it. It's not possible--it--in God's name, man, what\n",
      "caused this?\" Carl finally gasped.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Perhaps you know her better by the name of the Countess Donella\n",
      "Moonard. The beautiful Countess Moonard and Moonere, the sorceress,\n",
      "daughter of the God of Sudre, are one. Your fiancée is marked for the\n",
      "sacrifice that for the last ten thousand years has offered up its\n",
      "beautiful captives to the greedy God of Sudre!\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Sudre is another world, another planet, with another scheme of\n",
      "life--a scheme of life more complex than any dream of our existence,\n",
      "more terrible than all the horrors of history, beyond comprehension\n",
      "by any of our sciences or philosophies. It is all we are, refined and\n",
      "horribly exaggerated in some phases, until our most potent symbols of\n",
      "evil are only weak caricatures beside it. It is evil transcendent and\n",
      "all-powerful. It is the natural, purged of any goodness, and become\n",
      "supernatural and transcendent. A few men of ancient Egypt knew of its\n",
      "existence, knew of the All-Powerful One of Sudre, who has been playing\n",
      "his evil jest upon the helpless people of this earth for countless\n",
      "centuries.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl could only stare at Pierre, trying to realize meaning from the\n",
      "strange sounds he made. It was as if he listened to a man from another\n",
      "world.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"You do not understand, I know.\" Pierre sat down again, wearily. \"But I\n",
      "will make you understand, if you will only hear me out. You must try to\n",
      "grasp what I tell you.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pleadingly Pierre's scarred hand reached across the desk and touched\n",
      "Carl's fingers. Hastily Pierre withdrew his hand as he saw the look of\n",
      "revulsion upon Carl's face. Carl felt himself sicken at the feeling of\n",
      "unearthly coldness of the man's skin. The feeling of coldness was not\n",
      "in keeping with the appearance. To look at him was to think of fire,\n",
      "all-consuming fire!\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"The way my hand felt to you just then is the way my skin is all over\n",
      "my body,\" Pierre said. \"Touch it, if you dare. You are a doctor.\n",
      "Examine me. These sores that look like boils and fire--feel them, and\n",
      "you will know the cold sensation of a billion miles of space.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl's hand moved slowly to Pierre's face. With dread reluctance, his\n",
      "fingertips traced over the pitted, irregular features. It was like\n",
      "feeling an iced corpse, only worse, for this flesh was alive. When he\n",
      "withdrew his hand, he beheld a trace of damp, bluish substance upon his\n",
      "fingers.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pierre spoke again: \"Last night when I told you of the stars, you\n",
      "wondered what they had to do with my going out. Now you see my hopeless\n",
      "state; you see the unspeakable ugliness of my face. You must believe\n",
      "that all of this is a part of the curse the stars have in store for\n",
      "those who defy Moonere. When the moon and the stars loom so brightly in\n",
      "the evening sky, my flesh boils; my blood steams and courses through\n",
      "my veins, sending poison, poison from Sudre--moon-poisoning throughout\n",
      "my body. It is not the heated fire of the sun or of a furnace, but a\n",
      "cold, blue fire that chills as it burns, yet burns more intensely than\n",

      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"I am slowly being destroyed, because I have defied Moonere and sought\n",

      "to be conscious every minute of your slow journey to death? Look! I'll\n",
      "show you a picture.\" Pierre took from his pocket a small photograph.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl looked from the photo to the man who stood before him. There was\n",
      "no resemblance. The picture was of an intelligent man in his late\n",
      "thirties. He was tall and straight, with a splendid, manly physique,\n",

      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Sudre is a world, a satellite of the outermost planet of our solar\n",

      "Even when it is on the other side of that planet--and it revolves\n",

      "silently borne the banner of humanity. Although I am only a few years\n",

      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Of course, and she called for you. I gave her the telephone number\n",

      "find the secret entrance that leads to the temple of the maidens. No\n",
      "one else could have found it. The home of the Countess Moonard was\n",
      "built sixty years ago; and in all of London, neither you nor Scotland\n",
      "Yard combined could find a trace of the architects who constructed it.\n",
      "It is so ingeniously arranged to mislead a curious snooper that one\n",
      "could spend the rest of his life wandering from one false corridor\n",
      "into another, never getting anywhere. No, only I could find the secret\n",
      "entrance that leads to the temple with its star-glass in the roof. The\n",
      "plan of the house is the same as was her first temple many centuries\n",
      "ago.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Of course; that is, the lifetime of Moonere does not correspond with\n",
      "any human conception of a life-span. Moonere, or the Countess Moonard,\n",
      "as she has been known here in London, is from another planet, and has\n",
      "lived on this earth, serving the God of Sudre, for many ages. As long\n",
      "as she serves faithfully, she will live at his will. If she never\n",
      "offends her fiendish deity, she will live eternally. Even in my family,\n",
      "where the knowledge of her has existed for many centuries, there is no\n",
      "record of her beginning. You will find that hard to believe, because\n",
      "such things are beyond the comprehension of men. It will always be so\n",
      "with the mysteries of this world. Only a few learn the solemn secrets,\n",
      "and they find their knowledge a curse, their lips forever sealed by\n",
      "man's eternal skepticism.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"But as I started to tell you, when Moonere and I finally clashed,\n",
      "my ray proved a failure--a fault I have corrected. I was seized and\n",
      "dragged down into the center of the temple. My clothes were torn from\n",
      "me, and I was thrown upon the altar. The crystal burned; the poison\n",
      "crept into my body. I thought that my time had arrived, that this would\n",
      "mean death. But that was not her plan. I was exposed only for a few\n",
      "brief moments, much the same as the convert who takes the final vows.\n",
      "Then I was released. Mind you, I was set free. I could go to the police\n",
      "and Scotland Yard if I wanted to. I could tell them my story.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Do you think they would believe such a story? Furthermore, even if I\n",
      "took them to the temple, to the very altar, what could I prove? Upon\n",
      "the surface, Moonere has nothing that would arouse any suspicion beyond\n",
      "ordinary curiosity.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"But your face--you were horribly disfigured after the exposure to the\n",
      "glass, were you not?\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"No. That is not the way the glass first interprets the ray of Sudre.\n",
      "Those exposed to it for only a brief moment upon the altar, find that\n",
      "their youth, their physical charm, is doubly enhanced. When I was\n",
      "thrown from the temple, I looked years younger; my hair, which was\n",
      "turning gray before I entered, became black and glossy again. I could\n",
      "not look into a mirror without realizing the wonderful appearance\n",
      "that had been given to me. But it was only temporary. That is the way\n",
      "Moonere holds her victims for ever, sealing their lips, and bending\n",
      "them to unending servitude. The beauty does not last. Only by constant\n",
      "bathing in the rays beneath the glass can one keep fresh. Deny yourself\n",
      "those rays and the aid of Moonere, and you find your entire body slowly\n",
      "being destroyed. One look into the mirror, by a victim so denied, is\n",
      "enough to enslave the soul with fear.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Any night when the heavens are filled with the diffused rays of its\n",
      "many bodies, and Sudre is between earth and the planet about which it\n",
      "revolves, the torture of slowly being burned to a cinder increases\n",
      "for me. That is why I remain inside my home, which I have succeeded\n",
      "in partially insulating from them. That is why I can walk about in\n",
      "the fresh air upon only those all too few dark nights. In my home, I\n",
      "work with my inventions, the findings of many years of research by\n",
      "my family. But each night, Moonere and the Thing of Sudre send their\n",
      "rays to me. It is their jest, a further extension of their joy in\n",
      "the torture of mere mortals. My body now has an attraction for those\n",
      "rays. Even behind the closed, insulated walls, I feel their burn. With\n",
      "my present ray-machine, I have been combating them. Every night, if\n",
      "you could only see with your normal eyes the battle of Moonere's ray\n",
      "of death and my own discovered ray, you would know what a strange,\n",
      "unbelievable life I lead.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl looked wan and weary. Just now it seemed to him that there was\n",
      "nothing real about anything. The man who stood before him with his\n",
      "horrible face, his story of Moonere--everything was like a mad plot and\n",
      "setting for a dream of horror. All he could do was trust and pray that,\n",
      "through this man who knew the secrets, Ruth would be saved from a life\n",
      "far worse than death.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

      "anything to save Ruth from this life.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Then you must come with me.\" Pierre stood up and threw his cape\n",
      "about his face. \"I will take you to my home. There are many things I\n",
      "must teach you before tomorrow night, the night of the sacrifice. I\n",
      "will have great need of your assistance in my laboratory. You will be\n",
      "protected with everything my knowledge can give you. Perhaps I should\n",
      "warn you that I believe tomorrow night Moonere will seek to destroy me\n",
      "entirely. If you are with me, you may suffer a similar fate. Shall we\n",
      "go?\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"We go!\" Carl rose to his feet, and hurriedly put on his coat and hat.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Once outside, under the low-hanging canopy of the black night's sky,\n",
      "Pierre breathed heavily, as if the murky air of night was doubly\n",
      "precious to him.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Young man, you are about to witness what no one outside my own family\n",
      "has ever seen. You will see the work of many past generations, and you\n",
      "will see strange inventions that are of the future. Science has been\n",
      "very slow in its progress, compared with what my family has achieved.\"\n",
      "Pierre laughed, a rather cracked and squeaky laugh, somewhat disturbing\n",
      "to Carl; it was the first time he had heard the man laugh. \"Indeed,\n",
      "my boy, if you live through this, you will never forget it; yet you\n",
      "will never be able to tell another soul. Imagine it! How little the\n",
      "people on this world really know of what is going on about them! Here\n",
      "is busy, foggy, magnificent, dingy, dirty London with her many souls\n",
      "living their frustrated daily lives, their noses to the ground; and\n",
      "every night a drama they can never see is played up there in the sky.\n",
      "In their very midst two houses hold the powers and the secrets of ages\n",
      "beyond recall!\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pierre's home was a decaying old town house of red brick, with bleak\n",
      "shuttered windows and a gray slate roof. Conservative and ancient, it\n",
      "stood like an unfriendly hermit, far back from the street.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl was impressed with the solid, substantial appearance of the old\n",
      "house. At one end of it, the north wing, was a glass-enclosed room,\n",
      "beginning at the second story and ending slightly above the regular\n",
      "roof-line of the building. The front door was of fortified steel. To\n",
      "the dull surface of the door was secured a substantial bronze tablet,\n",
      "covered with a rich patina of long exposure, on which were inscribed\n",
      "the words:\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "His question was answered with the silent movement of the steel door,\n",
      "as if someone had opened it from the inside; although in the dim light\n",
      "of the reception hall, Carl could see no sign of another occupant.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"It opens by cutting off the beam of light that passes from the post\n",
      "at one side of the door to the post on the other,\" Pierre said, as he\n",
      "ushered Carl into the hallway.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"You have them in some of your modern office buildings,\" Pierre\n",
      "continued. \"This door has opened that way for the past forty years. My\n",
      "father developed the principle. Come, we will go to my observatory.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pierre led Carl to a narrow stairway leading upward to the north\n",
      "wing. Up one flight they moved silently. A dim blue light illuminated\n",
      "the landing, and shed its ghostly rays down another hall. Up another\n",
      "flight, leading in the same general direction, they walked. Carl felt\n",
      "as if he were climbing slowly through a mad dream.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Passing through a heavy, rivet-studded door, they entered the\n",
      "laboratory. The room was vast, covering the entire top floor of the\n",
      "house. The glass enclosure which he had seen from outside served only\n",
      "one end and corner of this amazing room. The walls were of a peculiar\n",
      "gray, glowing softly as if phosphorescent. Throughout the entire\n",
      "expanse of the room there was arranged an incalculable assortment\n",
      "of instruments, switch-boards, control-panels, glass and polished\n",
      "chromium, copper and brass. To Carl it was like suddenly entering a\n",
      "room fitted with all the strange instruments of the alchemists, and yet\n",
      "it was like looking ahead, fifty, a hundred or even two hundred years\n",
      "into the future.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pierre led the astounded Carl over beneath the glass dome. Here seemed\n",
      "to be the major control position for all the complex horde of machines\n",
      "that filled the room. In the center of this circular space stood a\n",
      "small insulated platform. Upon it, supported by gleaming glass rods,\n",
      "stood a huge, hollow hemisphere, from which emanated an eery blue\n",
      "light. Coming closer and looking downward into it, Carl was thrilled to\n",
      "see moving objects, familiar outlines of buildings he knew belonged to\n",
      "that part of London called Piccadilly Circus.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"This will explain the question you asked me earlier in the evening.\n",
      "The inventors of modern television would be envious if they knew of\n",
      "this creation. I need no transmitting station to bring into my home any\n",
      "scene I may desire.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pierre quickly removed his cape, and began tinkering with an assortment\n",
      "of strange knobs upon a large panel back of the bowl. The Piccadilly\n",
      "Circus scene disappeared, and into its place came a picture of Ruth's\n",
      "deserted apartment.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Again Pierre turned the knobs, and the scene in the bowl became a\n",
      "moving panorama of London streets. Swiftly they passed, until the\n",
      "estate of the Countess Moonard appeared in the strange vessel.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"To explain its operation would take all of our time, my boy. I have\n",
      "many other things to show you, the work of my ancestors and myself.\n",
      "This magnetic bowl has been most helpful. Through it I have been able\n",
      "to follow the unholy activities of the Countess Moonard. That night\n",
      "after I left you, I hurried back here and drew the light-rays of the\n",
      "Countess Moonard's home into the bowl. I saw her anointing your fiancée\n",
      "with the oils in preparation for the sacrifice to come; saw her filling\n",
      "the mind of the girl with the evil suggestions of the God of Sudre.\n",
      "When Ruth was sent back to her apartment, still in the trance of\n",
      "Moonerism, I then took over her mind. I had to be cautious, as I did\n",
      "not want her to confuse my suggestions with the thoughts of Moonere.\n",
      "When you found Ruth this morning, the Countess and I were both battling\n",
      "for control of the girl's mind.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The little dials that traced the locations he wanted shivered onto the\n",
      "desired points, and Carl beheld a thrilling sight. In the bowl there\n",
      "was appearing a picture that resembled nothing of modern London. He saw\n",
      "a temple of ancient Egypt. The towering pillars along the side of the\n",
      "temple were adorned with strange hieroglyphics of forgotten beliefs.\n",
      "The vision moved slowly, like a motion-picture camera shot traveling\n",
      "to a close-up scene that ended at an altar where a mysterious fire was\n",
      "burning. The picture remained steady for only a moment, then moved\n",
      "on to a room filled with many pillows. Upon a richly draped couch,\n",
      "Carl saw his fiancée lying as if in deep slumber. Negro slaves were\n",
      "anointing her slim, white body with precious oils. The chamber of a\n",
      "princess in some forgotten age this could have been--but the girl was\n",
      "Ruth!\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"What are they doing to her?\" Carl cried out, his fingers reaching into\n",
      "the bowl as if he hoped to pluck her from the couch.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"They are making ready for the night of the sacrifice. Every woman who\n",
      "takes the vows of Moonere relinquishes her charms to the God of Sudre.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"It is the price each one pays for her beauty. Poor deluded fools!\n",
      "They come to the Countess, seeking beauty and charm with which to win\n",
      "and hold the man they love; instead, they give up their most priceless\n",
      "virtue. The God of Sudre takes their charms onto himself.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Slowly the picture moved down the magnificent room. It approached a\n",
      "bronze platform, and paused. There upon the bronze dais, standing\n",
      "erect, was the golden image of a man, or demigod. The image was about\n",
      "seven feet tall. The details were perfectly wrought, and every muscle\n",
      "and fiber of that magnificent nude statue was the embodiment of the\n",
      "perfect development of masculinity. Yet it was a sensual development,\n",
      "eliminating all that might be good, and emphasizing all that is base\n",
      "and carnal. The face was cruel beyond any conception of men. The\n",
      "features were sharply brutal. Silent and motionless it stood, but the\n",
      "eyes were alive; and from them burned a dull, blue-black light that\n",
      "chilled Carl's blood as he watched.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"That is the image of the God of Sudre,\" explained Pierre. \"Tonight,\n",
      "when the rays from Sudre become most intense, Sudre's spirit will\n",
      "enter it, and it will become imbued with life, the evil life of Sudre.\n",
      "Tonight it will indulge in an orgy of lust at which even the most\n",
      "dissolute of ancient Romans would have shuddered. Your bride-to-be is\n",
      "to give herself for ever to Sudre, and for ever she will be lost to\n",
      "you. No mortal man will ever possess her.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"But what are you going to do to save her? You haven't told me yet how\n",
      "this monster can be stopped.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Everything I have and know, I will use. If I fail\"--Pierre's shoulders\n",
      "shrugged--\"there is no one to carry out my work. If I win, Moonere will\n",
      "be destroyed; the tortured souls, who have given all for beauty, will\n",
      "at last be free. We have only a few hours more. As we have talked, this\n",
      "night has passed. Another day is upon us; with its end comes the night\n",
      "when the evil rays will be fully focussed. Moonere will again send the\n",
      "hellish light that I have fought. Tonight I will use everything to\n",
      "combat her--telepathy, advanced knowledge of science, and secrets that\n",
      "will die with me.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"You will be helping me. Within these all too short hours, you will be\n",
      "learning the operation of the many machines. Follow me.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pierre led him to another corner of the room, where an instrument, not\n",
      "unlike a telescope, was placed. He handed Carl a pair of glasses with\n",
      "very thick, colored lenses.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"It looks like a beam of light, but it seems to stop in the sky; it is\n",
      "like a highway of white marble that ends abruptly,\" Carl said.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"You see the ray from the fire on Sudre, traveling at a faster speed\n",
      "than light, bringing with it the secret of beauty and death that only\n",
      "the star-glass of Moonere can transmute to potency. Now watch this!\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pierre moved to a high stand that supported a cone-shaped searchlight\n",
      "reflector. He made several deft adjustments, and then pushed in a\n",
      "switch on the long panel that ran the length of the room. Carl, with\n",
      "the aid of the glasses, could see a light-beam shoot into the heavens\n",
      "and travel in the direction of the beam that seemed suspended in the\n",
      "sky.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"This is my latest invention. Everything depends upon it. Tonight you\n",
      "will see a spectacular sight. Everything we do will be controlled from\n",
      "here. You and I, working with science, destroying that which is beyond\n",
      "this planet.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl looked about him. He reached out his hand and touched a metal\n",
      "laboratory bench; its solidity reassured his slipping sense of the\n",
      "reality of it all. Dazed, he wandered again to the bowl. What he saw\n",
      "made him start as if he had been shot with electricity. Inspector\n",
      "Chadwick was struggling with two brawny servants in the temple.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"The fool!\" he rasped. \"Why did he go there? I thought you had warned\n",
      "that detective friend of yours to keep out of this. Now they will make\n",
      "him a prisoner. They may not wait until tonight for the sacrifice to\n",
      "destroy him.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Nothing, unless they hold him for the dance of the maidens in the\n",
      "temple. One thing certain, he will be burned as I was, or even\n",
      "destroyed upon the altar. Watch closely, and you will see why no one\n",
      "has ever betrayed the secret of Moonere.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Breathlessly Carl watched them drag Chadwick into a small throneroom\n",
      "where the Countess Moonard, clothed in the robes of an ancient\n",
      "priestess, sat in serene majesty.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "They threw him down in front of the throne. He rose and shook his fist\n",
      "threateningly at the Countess. She smiled; her long, deeply beautiful\n",
      "eyes looked into his face. His trembling arms stopped shaking and\n",
      "dropped limply to his side. He stood in hypnotized rigidity. She\n",
      "pointed to a door that slowly opened. Chadwick walked meekly through\n",
      "it. The slaves bowed before the Countess and followed him through the\n",
      "door.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"He's going into the dungeon. They are saving him for a later\n",
      "sacrifice,\" Pierre said, almost relieved. \"That means we have time; we\n",
      "may save him.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Chadwick wouldn't have gone to the Countess' unless he suspected\n",
      "something more than he let me know. He must have been well protected.\n",
      "He's no fool. A man can't just disappear--not an Inspector from\n",
      "Scotland Yard. Chadwick would have his men following him. They will get\n",
      "him out of that dungeon,\" Carl spoke with growing determination.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The bowl showed Chadwick's men rushing into the reception hall of the\n",
      "Countess' home. Twisting the knob again, the bowl revealed the Countess\n",
      "smiling innocently. A servant brought in three of Chadwick's men. They\n",
      "began talking angrily to the Countess. Then the door where Chadwick had\n",
      "gone down into the dungeon opened. He came out, and began talking to\n",
      "his men.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Yes, he has instructed them to go. He has told them there is nothing\n",
      "wrong. Your friend's mind no longer belongs to him; his every thought,\n",
      "his words are the words and thoughts of Moonere. She has told him to\n",
      "send the men away, assuring them that nothing is wrong. You see they\n",
      "are gone. And now Chadwick returns to the dungeon.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Why can't you take over his mind as you did Ruth's? You said you could\n",
      "do it. Why can't you free him from Moonere's grasp?\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"I can,\" Pierre answered calmly, \"but to do that would place your\n",
      "fiancée in danger. Every minute I have concentrated upon her. Within\n",
      "her mind is the continual conflict of two powers struggling for\n",
      "supremacy. For the present, it is best that I whisper, 'Peace and\n",
      "quiet,' to the girl. You see how she slumbers, so still and unmoving;\n",
      "that aids my plan.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"When the time comes for the sacrifice, they will discover that their\n",
      "lovely maiden is not to join their dance of passion.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"You need not fear, my friend; she will sleep, sleep; and nothing\n",
      "Moonere can do will make her gratify the desires of the evil God of\n",
      "Sudre. Tonight you will see a disappointed God!\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Throughout the hours, Carl crammed the many secrets of Pierre Soret's\n",
      "strange machines. It seemed to him that he had forced the learning of\n",
      "all the world into his brain.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Midnight found him staring with weary eyes into the sky. The night\n",
      "was clear; and above the dimly haze-rimmed horizon Carl could see the\n",
      "metallic glitter of the stars. Looking through the telescope with his\n",
      "specially designed glasses, he found the light-beam again. This time it\n",
      "hovered very closely to the center of the heavens.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "When the beam reached its zenith, he said: \"Now we will see the\n",
      "beginning of war.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In the globe, Carl could see the temple. The fire upon the altar was\n",
      "blazing brightly. Along the walls sat many slaves, playing strange\n",
      "musical instruments. The light in the temple was blue, the silvery,\n",
      "all-pervading blue of moonlight.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Tonight they will begin the dance of invitation to the God of Sudre.\"\n",
      "Pierre peered over Carl's shoulder into the bowl. \"Before his golden\n",
      "image, they will perform the subtle dance of seduction, inviting him to\n",
      "come and take them in his arms, and embrace them. You see the beam of\n",
      "light. From Sudre it has traveled the miles of space, and hurried with\n",
      "its concentrated rays into the star-glass. See how the flames upon the\n",
      "altar blaze tonight. The dance begins with Moonere's entrance. She will\n",
      "give her signal. Watch!\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The Countess Moonard entered the temple from a small door at one\n",
      "end, walked slowly through the throng, each worshipper bowing as she\n",
      "passed, and came before the image of Sudre. Standing there, she was\n",
      "both terrifying and beautiful. Her body became slowly rigid. She flung\n",
      "back her head, and her long, black hair fell down behind her. Her\n",
      "body glowed with sensuous intensity. She raised her arms slowly, in\n",
      "supplication and desire, and then let them fall to her side.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The musicians increased the tempo of their playing. Onto the floor of\n",
      "the temple came the dancing forms of many beautiful women, clad only in\n",
      "their long hair that waved like misty light about their supple bodies.\n",
      "Arms outstretched, they danced rhythmically before the idol. In the\n",
      "pale blue light of the temple, their forms were like white marble\n",
      "statues suddenly breathing life. Around and around before the God they\n",
      "danced, their passionate movements growing more and more intense.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl watched, revolted and yet fascinated by the obscene gyrations\n",
      "of these beautiful nude dancers who threw their charms in rhythmic\n",
      "supplication toward the golden image.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Shadows darted about the temple walls, shadows of arms raised high\n",
      "and lowered quickly across sculptured white curves, shadows of bodies\n",
      "thrusting and withdrawing with compelling seductiveness. Beautiful\n",
      "faces, swelling breasts, and eyes that cried for love--the love of an\n",
      "inhuman idol of gold!\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl could not speak; he could only stare into the glowing sphere.\n",
      "The golden image was moving! Slowly the sinewy muscles of its arms\n",
      "moved downward; strong golden fingers felt along its thighs; its chest\n",
      "expanded as it drew in the scented breath of the temple. Carl saw the\n",
      "arm of the God reach down and bring up a lovely white form. He saw her\n",
      "swoon with pleasure in the embrace of this golden image that now lived.\n",
      "He saw the God release the white form of the girl, saw her fair body\n",
      "writhe with tormented desire, her hands clutching eagerly for him. On\n",
      "he walked to the throne beside the altar. As he walked, the maidens\n",
      "bent down before him, their lips caressed his feet, slender fingers\n",
      "sought to touch him as he moved majestically above that sea of adoring\n",
      "flesh. Moonere bowed before him. He touched her shoulder, and raised\n",
      "her up to meet his lips in the lingering kiss. Then he sat down upon\n",
      "the scarlet throne.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Food and wine were brought to him by the maidens, each seeking to\n",
      "outdo the others in her attentions. They fairly groveled at his throne.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Now they will bring him the new sacrifice,\" Pierre said tensely. \"I\n",
      "will let her walk slowly so that Moonere will fail to see that my mind\n",
      "controls her. But he will never possess her!\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Ruth entered the temple, her eyes staring glassily in front of her.\n",
      "From her shoulders trailed a flimsy white cloth, her slender form\n",
      "gleaming through it in the pale blue light. Two of the maidens led her\n",
      "to the Golden God. In torment, Carl watched him feast his eyes upon\n",
      "Ruth's beauty. Unable to stand the sight, Carl turned from the globe.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "He looked beseechingly to Pierre. The man's lips moved in formless\n",
      "speech. Pierre was talking to Ruth, he knew. He looked again to see\n",
      "if it had worked. Carl gasped as he saw Ruth fall in a crumpled faint\n",
      "before the throne. Moonere rushed to her. The maidens began laboring\n",
      "over Ruth's lifeless form. The Golden Image frowned. Carl watched the\n",
      "look of surprize fade from Moonere's face; slowly, gradually it became\n",
      "a smiling mask of cruelty. Pierre was now laughing.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Ah, they do not enjoy that! Moonere is puzzled. Moonere and the Golden\n",
      "God of Sudre are disappointed for once!\" his voice rasped. He shook his\n",
      "fist into the globe. \"Now what will you do, Moonere? What will you do\n",
      "to me?\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As Pierre spoke, Carl saw Moonere dart to the altar and pull quickly\n",
      "upon some heavy chains that hung in front of the blazing fire. Slowly\n",
      "a shining disk of platinum appeared. Moonere swung it rapidly until it\n",
      "caught the light of the hellish fire that burned upon the altar. Its\n",
      "glistening surface began to glow. Suddenly a blinding flash of light\n",
      "engulfed the globe before the two figures concentrated in front of it.\n",
      "Pierre's vast room filled with a strange purple and blue-green light.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Quick! Turn on the ray-machine!\" Pierre cried, pushing Carl out of his\n",
      "way as he hurried to the panel. \"Your glasses, don't forget them. Don't\n",
      "forget to turn Z-4. And when I tell you, let me have R-9.\" Pierre was\n",
      "shouting now.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "All through the room the strange light shattered into millions of\n",
      "little stars. The ray from Pierre's machine shot upward through the\n",
      "sky. Carl saw it cross the ray that was coming from Sudre. The sky in\n",
      "the vicinity of the rays, that could only be seen through Pierre's\n",
      "glasses, was filled with a mighty conflict of fire.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"More phosphorous liquid. Hurry! Hurry!\" Pierre was almost screaming\n",
      "now. Carl pulled the lever, and the liquid poured into a tank beside\n",
      "the ray-machine. He worked feverishly, following Pierre's orders.\n",
      "Everything he had previously rehearsed, he now performed rapidly and\n",
      "automatically. He turned knobs, pulled switches, poured mysterious\n",
      "liquids into tanks, watched a pageantry of light and small sparkling\n",
      "stars leap about the room, dancing from corner to corner.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The room grew hotter. Perspiration dripped from Carl's face as he\n",
      "struggled to follow the orders issued by Pierre. Although he knew what\n",
      "to do when Pierre commanded, he did not know what each separate action\n",
      "meant. It was enough that he could recognize the orders and could do\n",
      "what must have been the simplest of things in this maze of wizardry and\n",
      "science Pierre had developed.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "As Carl worked over a boiling vat that contained a thick mixture of\n",
      "evil-smelling chemicals, he felt a severe burning sensation at the back\n",
      "of his neck. Turning his head slightly, he saw two yellow flames shoot\n",
      "toward him from the switch-board panel.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Take that other tube and place it in the switch-box. Tube X! Tube X!\"\n",
      "Pierre's tone was frantic.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl whirled around in his excitement, and as he did so, a bottle fell\n",
      "with an explosive crash. Smoke and fire leaped up from the floor.\n",
      "Pierre quenched it quickly with an extinguisher. The heat of the room\n",
      "was beginning to show upon Carl, and he sensed that in a moment he\n",
      "would pass into unconsciousness.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The tube placed in the box as Pierre had directed, Carl staggered\n",
      "blindly back to his duties between the tank and the switch-board panel.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Something's wrong! Something's wrong!\" he heard Pierre say in a\n",
      "croaking voice. The fear that gripped him made it impossible for Carl\n",
      "to ask what was wrong.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pierre turned from the ray-machine. Carl saw him, and for the moment\n",
      "went insane! Pierre's face was gone! There was only a blue light\n",
      "shining from the open gap that had once been the face of Pierre Soret.\n",
      "Somewhere in that horrible sight were two white pin-points that\n",
      "retained a semblance of the man's eyes. Bluish smoke was issuing from\n",
      "his entire body.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"We must work fast; perhaps you can finish what I have started,\"\n",
      "Pierre's broken voice came from the awful vision that represented him.\n",
      "\"My ray-machine is not powerful enough; I cannot concentrate the rays\n",
      "on the temple with sufficient intensity to effect my purpose. You must\n",
      "take my concentration mirror, which is similar to the one you saw\n",
      "Moonere use. I must release your fiancée from my mind. You must submit\n",
      "yourself to me. I will send you to the temple, if I last that long.\n",
      "Your fiancée will be at their mercy until you arrive.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Sensing the danger, Carl hurried to the globe. Ruth was stretched upon\n",
      "a couch in front of the throne. The maidens were working desperately\n",
      "to revive her, while the Golden Image of Sudre glowered down upon her.\n",
      "Carl realized that once Pierre released his grip upon her mind, Moonere\n",
      "would send her into the greedy clutches of Sudre. Ruth would be lost to\n",
      "him.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"No! I can't permit it. You must save her!\" he cried. \"But how? Man,\n",
      "you are gone! You do not live, you can't exist as you are! In heaven's\n",
      "name, how could you hope to save anyone, how can you even speak? How?\n",
      "How?\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"This is the only way. Do not doubt me. The rays are destroying me.\n",
      "Everything is going fast. You must go, and I will direct you,\" Pierre\n",
      "said sternly.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Already Carl could feel the electric touch of Pierre's intellect\n",
      "usurping his. Even his voice sounded weak as he cried out: \"No! Save\n",
      "Ruth! Save Ruth! Keep her asleep. Keep her--aslee----\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The blue fire that was Pierre became larger; nothing but blue, blue\n",
      "light filled his eyes; and Pierre, the mind of the great but tortured\n",
      "scientist, filled Carl's brain.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"You will take your car and speed to the Countess Moonard's. Make all\n",
      "haste. Nothing can stop you. You _must_ get there!\" Carl heard Pierre's\n",
      "voice as a whisper.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "At first he moved stiffly, as if each step needed the command of the\n",
      "man who now controlled his brain. Gradually the feeling decreased. Carl\n",
      "Fielding became Pierre Soret!\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Through the streets that led to the Countess Moonard's star-haunted\n",
      "residence, Carl's roadster sped like a silver bullet upon an errand of\n",
      "mercy. Twice he would have met certain death had it not been for the\n",
      "super-intellect that made quick thinking snap his movements with the\n",
      "deft skill of a racing driver.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Go faster! There is little time to lose. Go faster! Do not be afraid,\"\n",
      "the voice of the professor rasped. The wind whipped past Carl's face.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl froze as he heard the next words of the man who gripped his brain.\n",
      "\"Do not be afraid; nothing can harm you now, for you are not guided by\n",
      "the normal destiny of a human. Something stronger leads me on, and I\n",
      "in turn send you upon this errand which may mean death for you. Some\n",
      "Greater Power of Good now seems to be working against the Evil Thing of\n",
      "Sudre.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"I am slowly being burned to some strange form, I know not what, but my\n",

      "perhaps. You are at the command of my brain.\"\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Carl could not stop now, and even the mighty fear that shook him hurled\n",
      "him forward. On he drove, knowing that every turn he made was being\n",
      "watched by Pierre in the globe--but there was nothing he could do; he\n",
      "was driven by a force far stronger than himself.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"Stop at the servant's entrance,\" Pierre said, as Carl turned his car\n",

      "strange as all my life has been, strange as all the stories of my\n",
      "family's struggle against the evil God of Sudre, I have never been\n",
      "really frightened until now--now I find myself upon the brink of\n",

      "\"There is nothing but dreary coldness here; and in the darkness,\n",
      "gray-lined specters hover all about me. Surely this is the realm\n",
      "between the known and the unknown. It is strange to me, like a vast\n",
      "sea of doubt surrounding my soul--yet in the distance I see a light, a\n",
      "light of infinite brightness.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

      "cannot be, for now, even here, I feel that same moving faith, the\n",
      "magnetic power of good, drawing me on to some better destination. It\n",
      "must be so. Even though I no longer live on earth, and I wander in a\n",
      "land of dreadful strangeness, surely I have conquered evil.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"You are listening, my friend? You hear me speak to you from beyond the\n",

      "through the portal that would lead them to the outside. He beckoned to\n",
      "the bewildered souls who had witnessed the end of their unholy service\n",
      "to another god. They followed like innocent sheep. Only a few of the\n",

      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
