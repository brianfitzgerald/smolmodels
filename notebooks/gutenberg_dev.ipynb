       "looked out upon a wintry Boston street. It was a room rather empty and\n",
       "undecorated, but the idea of austerity was banished by a temperature\n",
       "so nearly tropical. There were rows of books on white shelves, a pale\n",
       "Donatello cast on the wall, and two fine bronze vases filled with roses on\n",

       "well-known German painter, and all about the room were photographs of young\n",
       "women, most of them young mothers, with smooth heads and earnest faces,\n",
       "holding babies. Outside, the snow was heaped high along the pavements\n",
       "and thickly ridged the roofs and lintels. After the blizzard the sun was\n",
       "shining and all the white glittered. The national colors, to a patriotic\n",

       "The three people who talked, with many intimate pauses of silence, were all\n",
       "Bostonians, though of widely different types. The hostess, sitting in an\n",
       "easy chair and engaged with some sewing, was a girl of about twenty-six.\n",
       "She wore a brown skirt of an ugly cut and shade and a white silk shirt,\n",
       "adorned with a high linen collar, a brown tie and an old-fashioned gold\n",
       "watch-chain. Her forehead was too large, her nose too short; but her lips\n",
       "were full and pleasant and when she smiled she showed charming teeth. The\n",
       "black-rimmed glasses she wore emphasized the clearness and candor of her\n",
       "eyes. Her thick, fair hair was firmly fastened in a group of knobs down the\n",
       "back of her head. There was an element of the grotesque in her appearance\n",
       "and in her careful, clumsy movements, yet, with it, a quality almost\n",
       "graceful, that suggested homely and wholesome analogies,--freshly-baked\n",
       "bread; fair, sweet linen; the safety and content of evening firesides. This\n",
       "was Mary Colton.\n",
       "\n",
       "The girl who sat near the window, her furs thrown back from her shoulders,\n",
       "a huge muff dangling from her hand, was a few years younger and exceedingly\n",
       "pretty. Her skin was unusually white, her hair unusually black, her velvety\n",
       "eyes unusually large and dark. In. her attitude, lounging, graceful,\n",
       "indifferent, in her delicate face, the straight, sulky brows, the coldly\n",
       "closed lips, the coldly observant eyes, a sort of permanent discontent was\n",
       "expressed, as though she could find, neither in herself nor in the world,\n",
       "any adequate satisfaction. This was Rose Packer.\n",
       "\n",
       "The other guest, sitting sidewise on a stiff chair, his hand hanging over\n",
       "the back, his long legs crossed, was a young man, graceful, lean and\n",
       "shabby. He was clean-shaven, with brown skin and golden hair, an unruly\n",
       "lock lying athwart his forehead. His face, intent, alert, was veiled in\n",
       "an indolent nonchalance. He looked earnest, yet capricious, staunch, yet\n",
       "sensitive, and one felt that, conscious of these weaknesses, he tried to\n",
       "master or to hide them.\n",
       "\n",
       "These three had known one another since childhood. Jack's family was old\n",
       "and rich; Mary's old and poor; Rose Packer's new and of fantastic wealth.\n",
       "Rose was a young woman of fashion and her whole aspect seemed to repudiate\n",
       "any closeness of tie between herself and Mary, who passed her time in\n",
       "caring for General Colton, her invalid father, attending committees, and,\n",
       "as a diversion, going to \"sewing-circles\" and symphony concerts; but she\n",
       "was fonder of Mary than of any one else in the world. Rose, who had, as\n",
       "it were, been brought up all over the world, divided her time now between\n",
       "two continents and quaintly diversified her dancing, hunting, yachting\n",
       "existence by the arduous study of biology. Jack, in appearance more\n",
       "ambiguous than either, looked neither useful nor ornamental; but, in point\n",
       "of fact, he was a much occupied person. He painted very seriously, was\n",
       "something of a scholar and devoted much of his time and most of his large\n",
       "fortune to intricate benevolences. His shabby clothes were assumed, like\n",
       "the air of indolence; his wealth irked him and, full of a democratic\n",
       "transcendentalism, he longed to efface all the signs that separated him\n",
       "from the average toiler. While Rose was quite ignorant of her own country\n",
       "west of the Atlantic seaboard, Jack had wandered North, South, West. As\n",
       "for Mary, she had hardly left Boston in her life, except to go to the\n",
       "Massachusetts coast in summer and to pay a rare visit now and then to New\n",
       "York. It was of such a visit that she had been talking to them and of the\n",
       "friend who, since her own return home only a few days before, had suffered\n",
       "a sudden bereavement in the death of her father. Jack Pennington, also a\n",
       "near friend of Imogen Upton's, had just come from New York, where he had\n",
       "been with her during the mournful ceremonies of death, and Mary Colton,\n",
       "after a little pause, had said, \"I suppose she was very wonderful through\n",
       "it all.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She bore up very well,\" said Jack Pennington. \"There would never be\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Never. And when one thinks what a grief it is. She is wonderful,\" said\n",
       "Mary.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You think every one wonderful, Molly,\" Rose Packer remarked, not at all\n",
       "aggressively, but with her air of quiet ill-temper.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mary's enthusiasm has hit the mark this time,\" said Pennington, casting a\n",
       "glance more scrutinizing than severe upon the girl.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I really can't see it. Of course Imogen Upton is pretty--remarkably\n",
       "pretty--though I've always thought her nose too small; and she is certainly\n",
       "clever; but why should she be called wonderful?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I think it is her goodness, Rose,\" said Mary, with an air of gentle\n",
       "willingness to explain. \"It's her radiant goodness. I know that Imogen has\n",
       "mastered philosophies, literatures, sciences--in so far as a young and very\n",
       "busy girl can master them, and that very wise men are glad to talk to her;\n",
       "but it's not of that one thinks--nor of her great beauty, either. Both seem\n",
       "taken up, absorbed in that selflessness, that loving-kindness, that's like\n",
       "a higher kind of cleverness--almost like a genius.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She's not nearly so good as you are, Molly. And after all, what does she\n",
       "do, anyway?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mary kept her look of leniency, as if over the half-playful naughtinesses\n",
       "of a child. \"She organizes and supports all sorts of charities, all sorts\n",
       "of reforms; she is the wisest, sweetest of hostesses; she takes care of her\n",
       "brother; she took care of her father;--she takes care of anybody who is in\n",
       "need or unhappy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Was Mr. Upton so unhappy? He certainly looked gloomy;--I hardly knew him;\n",
       "Eddy, however, I do know, very well; he isn't in the least unhappy. He\n",
       "doesn't need help.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I think we all need help, dear. As for Mr. Upton,--you know,\" Mary spoke\n",
       "very gravely now, \"you know about Mrs. Upton.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Of course I do, and what's better, I know her herself a little. _Elle est\n",
       "charmeuse_.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have never seen her,\" said Mary, \"but I don't understand how you can\n",
       "call a frivolous and heartless woman, who practically deserted her husband\n",
       "and children, _charmeuse_;--but perhaps that is all that one can call her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I like frivolous people,\" said Rose, \"and most women would have deserted\n",
       "Mr. Upton, if what I've heard of him was true.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What have you heard of him?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That he was a bombastic prig.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "At this Mary's pale cheek colored. \"Try to remember, Rose, that he died\n",
       "only a week ago.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, he may be different now, of course.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I can't bear to hear you speak so, Rose. I did know him. I saw a great\n",
       "deal of him during this last year. He was a very big person indeed.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Of course I'm a pig to talk like this, if you really liked him, Molly.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But Mary was not to be turned aside by such ambiguous apology. \"You see,\n",
       "you don't know, Rose. The pleasure-seeking, worldly people among whom you\n",
       "live could hardly understand a man like Mr. Upton. Simply what he did for\n",
       "civic reform,--worked himself to death over it. And his books on ethics,\n",
       "politics. It isn't a question of my liking him. I don't know that I ever\n",
       "thought of my feeling for him in those terms. It was reverence, rather, and\n",
       "gratitude for his being what he was.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, dear, I do remember hearing men, and not worldly men, as you call\n",
       "them, either, say that his work for civic reform amounted to very little\n",
       "and that his books were thin and unoriginal. As for that community place he\n",
       "founded at, where was it?--Clackville? He meddled that out of life.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He may have been Utopian, he may have been in some ways ineffectual; but\n",
       "he was a good man, a wonderful, yes, Rose, a wonderful man,\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And do you think that Molly has hit the mark in this, too?\" Rose asked,\n",
       "turning her eyes on Pennington. He had been listening with an air of light\n",
       "inattention and now he answered tersely, as if conquering some inner\n",
       "reluctance by over-emphasis, \"Couldn't abide him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Rose laughed out, though with some surprise in her triumph; and Mary,\n",
       "redder than before, rejoined in a low voice, \"I didn't expect you, Jack, to\n",
       "let personal tastes interfere with fair judgment.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, I'm not judging him,\" said Jack.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But do you feel with me,\" said Rose, \"that it's no wonder that Mrs. Upton\n",
       "left him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not in the least,\" Pennington replied, glad, evidently, to make clear his\n",
       "disagreement. \"I don't know of any reason that Mrs. Upton had for deserting\n",
       "not only her husband but her children.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But have they been left? Isn't it merely that they prefer to stay?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Prefer to live in their own country? among their own people? Certainly.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But she spends part of every year with them. There was never any open\n",
       "breach.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Everybody knew that she would not live with her husband and everybody knew\n",
       "why,\" Mary said. \"It has nearly broken Imogen's heart. She left him because\n",
       "he wouldn't lead the kind of life she wanted to lead--the kind of life she\n",
       "leads in England--one of mere pleasure and self-indulgent ease. She hasn't\n",
       "the faintest conception of duty or of patriotism. She couldn't help her\n",
       "husband in any way, and she wouldn't let him help her. All she cares for is\n",
       "fashion, admiration and pretty clothes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Stuff and nonsense, my dear! She doesn't think one bit more about her\n",
       "clothes than Imogen does. It requires more thought to look like a saint in\n",
       "velvet than to go to the best dressmaker and order a trousseau. I wonder\n",
       "how long it took Imogen to find out that way of doing her hair.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Rose!--I must beg of you--I love her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But I'm saying nothing against her!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When I think of what she is suffering now, what you say sounds cruelly\n",
       "irreverent. Jack, I know, feels as I do.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, he does,\" said the young man. He got up now and stood, very tall, in\n",
       "the middle of the room looking down at Mary. \"I must be off. I'll bring\n",
       "you those books to-morrow afternoon--though I don't see much good in your\n",
       "reading d'Annunzio.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why, if you do, Jack?\" said Mary, with some wonder. And the degree of\n",
       "intimate equality in the relations of these young people may be gaged by\n",
       "the fact that he appeared to receive her rejoinder as conclusive.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, he's interesting, of course, and if one wants to understand modern\n",
       "decadence in an all-round way--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I want to understand everything,\" said Mary. \"And please bring your best\n",
       "Italian dictionary with them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Before you go, Jack,\" said Rose, \"pray shut the register. It's quite\n",
       "stifling in here.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Far too hot,\" said Jack, showing his impartiality of spirit by his\n",
       "seconding of Rose's complaint, for it was evident she had much displeased\n",
       "him. \"I've often told you, Mary, how bad it was for you. That's why you are\n",
       "so pale.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I'm so sorry. Have you been feeling it much? Leave the door into the hall\n",
       "open.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And do cast one glance, if only of disapprobation, upon me, Jack,\" Rose\n",
       "pleaded in mock distress.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are a very amusing child, Rose, sometimes,\" was Pennington's only\n",
       "answer.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He's evidently very cross with me,\" said Rose, when he was gone. \"While\n",
       "you are not--you who have every right to be, angelic Molly.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I hope you didn't realize, Rose, how you were hurting him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I?\" Rose opened wide eyes. \"How, pray?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Don't you know that he is devoted to Imogen Upton?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why, who isn't devoted to her, except wicked me?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Devoted in particular--in love with her, I think,\" said Mary.\n",
       "\n",
       "Rose's face took on a more acutely discontented look, after the pause in\n",
       "which she seemed, though unrepentantly, to acquiesce in a conviction of\n",
       "ineptitude. \"Really in love with her?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I think so; I hope so.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How foolish of him,\" said Rose. Mary, at this, rested a gaze so long and\n",
       "so reproachful upon her that the discontent gave way to an affectionate\n",
       "compunction. \"The truth is, Mary, that I'm jealous; I'm petty; I'm horrid.\n",

       "people wonderful.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If you own that you are naughty, Rose, dear, and that you try hard to be\n",

       "much, much more?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, because of that--and all the rest. As for jealousy, one doesn't love\n",
       "people more because they are wonderful. One is glad of them and one longs\n",
       "to share them. It's one of my dearest hopes that you may come to care for\n",

       "\n",

       "Mrs. Wake was evidently determined to remain enigmatical; but Valerie Upton\n",
       "quietly drew aside her reserves. \"That is the trouble, you think; she\n",
       "hasn't.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is a symptom of the trouble. She doesn't suffer; she judges. It's\n",
       "very harmful for a young girl to sit in judgment.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But Valerie has seen her so much!\" Mrs. Pakenham cried, a little shocked\n",
       "at the other's ruthlessness. \"Three months of every year--almost.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Three months when they played hostess to each other. It was really Valerie\n",
       "who was the guest in the house when Imogen and her father were there. The\n",
       "relation was never normal. Now that poor Everard is gone, the necessary\n",
       "artificiality can cease. Valerie can try her hand at being a mother, not a\n",
       "guest. It will do both her and Imogen good.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That's just the conclusion I had come to. That's just how I had been\n",
       "seeing it.\" The fresh tea-pot was brought in at this juncture, and, as she\n",
       "spoke, Valerie roused herself to measure in the tea and pour on the boiling\n",
       "water. She showed them, thus, more fully, the grace, the freshness, the\n",
       "look of latent buoyancy that made her so young, that made her, even now, in\n",
       "her black dress and with her gravity, remind one of a flower, submerged,\n",
       "momentarily, in deep water, its color hardly blurred, its petals delicately\n",
       "crisp, its fragrance only needing air and sunlight to diffuse itself. For\n",
       "all the youthfulness, a quality of indolent magic was about her, a soft\n",
       "haze, as it were, woven of matured experience, of detachment from youth's\n",
       "self-absorption, of the observer's kindly, yet ironic, insight. Her figure\n",
       "was supple; her nut-brown hair, splendidly folded at the back of her head,\n",
       "was hardly touched with white; her quickly glancing, deliberately pausing,\n",
       "eyes were as clear, as pensive, as a child's; with almost a child's candor\n",
       "of surprise in the upturning of their lashes. A brunette duskiness in the\n",
       "rose of lips and cheeks, in the black brows, in the fruit-like softness of\n",
       "outline, was like a veil drawn across and dimming the fairness that paled\n",
       "to a pearly white at throat and temples. Her upper lip was ever so faintly\n",
       "shadowed with a brunette penciling of down, and three _grains de beauté_,\n",
       "like tiny patches of velvet, seemed applied with a pretty coquetry, one on\n",
       "her lip and two high on her cheek, where they emphasized and lent a touch\n",
       "of the Japanese to her smile. Even her physical aspect carried out the\n",
       "analogy of something vivid and veiled. She was clear as day, yet melting,\n",
       "merged, elusive, like the night; and in her glance, in her voice, was that\n",
       "mingled brightness and shadow. When she had given them their tea she left\n",
       "her friends, taking her toasted little dog, languid and yawning, under her\n",
       "arm, and, at a sharp yelp from this petted individual, his paw struck by\n",
       "the opening of the door, they heard her exclaiming in contrition over him,\n",
       "\"Darling lamb! did his wicked mother hurt him!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Pakenham and Mrs. Wake sipped their tea for some time in silence, and\n",
       "it was Mrs. Pakenham who voiced at last the thought uppermost for both of\n",
       "them, \"I wonder how Sir Basil will take it.\"\n",

       "more than either of them have, I'm quite sure, poor, lovely dears.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, one certainly can't help it,\" Mrs. Wake acquiesced. \"Though I,\n",
       "perhaps, should have been too prudish to own to it just now--with poor\n",
       "Everard hardly in his grave. But that's the comfort of being with a frank,\n",

       "responsibility.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Pakenham smiled over her friend's self-exposure and helped her to\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I don't know; I really don't know,\" Mrs. Wake mused.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Yes, so beautifully and so gracefully that while one does know that, one\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh, it's not that she doesn't care--\"\n",

       "him, either--finally out of the way; a reverential adorer at hand; youth\n",
       "still theirs; money; a delightful place--what more could one ask?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah,\" Mrs. Wake sighed a little, \"I don't know. It's not, perhaps, that one\n",
       "would ask more, but less. It's too pretty, too easy, too _à propos_; so\n",
       "much so that it frightens me a little. Valerie has, you see, made a mess of\n",
       "it. She has, you see, spoiled her life, in that aspect of it. To mend it\n",
       "now, so completely, to start fresh at--how old is she?--at forty-six, it's\n",
       "just a little glib. Somehow one doesn't get off so easily as that. One\n",
       "can't start so happily at forty-six. Perhaps one is wiser not to try.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, nonsense, my dear! It's very American, that, you know, that picking of\n",
       "holes in excellent material, furbishing up your consciences, running after\n",
       "your motives as if you were ferrets in a rat-hole. If all you have to say\n",
       "against it is that it's too perfect, too happy,--why, then I keep to my own\n",

       "\n",
       "Mrs. Upton was in the drawing-room next morning when Sir Basil Thremdon\n",
       "was announced. She had not seen this old friend and neighbor since the\n",
       "news of her bereavement had reached her, and now, rising to meet him, a\n",
       "consciousness of all that had changed for her, a consciousness, perhaps\n",
       "more keen, of all that had changed for him, showed in a deepening of her\n",
       "color.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Basil was a tall, spare, stalwart man of fifty, the limpid innocence of\n",
       "his blue eyes contrasting with his lean, aquiline countenance. His hair and\n",
       "mustache were bleached by years to a light fawn-color and his skin tanned\n",
       "by a hardy life to a deep russet; and these tints of fawn and russet\n",
       "predominated throughout his garments with a pleasing harmony, so that in\n",
       "his rough tweeds and riding-gaiters he seemed as much a product of the\n",
       "nature outside as any bird or beast. The air of a delightfully civilized\n",
       "rurality was upon him, an air of landowning, law-dispensing, sporting\n",
       "efficiency; and if, in the fitness of his coloring, he made one think of a\n",
       "fox or a pheasant, in character he suggested nothing so much as one of the\n",
       "deep-rooted oaks of his own park. His very simplicity and uncomplexity of\n",
       "consciousness was as fresh, as wholesome, as genially encompassing, as full\n",
       "summer foliage. One rested in his shade.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was an inarticulate person and his eyes, now, in their almost seared\n",
       "solicitude, spoke more of sympathy and tenderness than his halting tongue.\n",
       "He ended by repeating a good many times that he hoped she wasn't too\n",
       "frightfully pulled down. Mrs. Upton said that she was really feeling very\n",
       "well, though conscious that her sincerity might somewhat bewilder her\n",
       "friend in his conceptions of fitness, and they sat down side by side on a\n",
       "small sofa near the window.\n",
       "\n",
       "We have said that for the first years of her freedom Mrs. Upton had been\n",
       "very gay. Of late years the claims on her resources from the family across\n",
       "the Atlantic had a good deal clipped her wings, and, though she made a\n",
       "round of spring and of autumn visits, she spent her time for the most part\n",
       "in her little Surrey house, engaged desultorily in gardening, study, and\n",
       "the entertainment of the friend or two always with her. She had not found\n",
       "it difficult to fold her wings and find contentment in the more nest-like\n",
       "environment. She had never been a woman to seek, accepting only, happily,\n",
       "whatever gifts life brought her; and it seemed as natural to her that\n",
       "things should be taken as that things should be given. But with the\n",
       "renouncement of more various outlooks this autumnal quietness, too, had\n",
       "brought its gift, discreet, delicate, a whispered sentence, as it were,\n",
       "that one could only listen to blindfolded, but that, once heard, gave one\n",
       "the knowledge of a hidden treasure. Sir Basil had been one of the reasons,\n",
       "the greatest reason, for her happiness in the Surrey nest. It was since\n",
       "coming there to live that she had grown to know him so well, with the\n",
       "slow-developing, deep-rooted intimacy of country life. The meadows and\n",
       "parks of Thremdon Hall encompassed all about the heath where Valerie\n",
       "Upton's cottage stood among its trees. They were Sir Basil's woods that ran\n",
       "down to her garden walls and Sir Basil's lanes that, at the back of the\n",
       "cottage, led up, through the heather, to the little village, a mile or so\n",
       "away. She had met Sir Basil before coming to live there, once or twice in\n",
       "London, and once or twice for week-ends at country-houses; but he was not a\n",
       "person whom one came really to know in drawing-room conditions; indeed, at\n",
       "the country-houses one hardly saw him except at breakfast and dinner; he\n",
       "was always hunting, golfing, or playing billiards, and in the interludes to\n",
       "these occupations one found him a trifle somnolent. It was after settling\n",
       "quite under his wing--and that she was under it she had discovered only\n",
       "after falling in love with the little white cottage and rushing eagerly\n",
       "into tenancy--that she had found out what a perfect neighbor he was; then\n",
       "come to feel him as a near friend; then, as those other friends had termed\n",
       "it, to care for him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie Upton, herself, had never called it by any other name, this feeling\n",
       "about Sir Basil; though it was inevitable, in a woman of her clearness of\n",
       "vision, that she should very soon recognize a more definite quality in Sir\n",
       "Basil's feeling about her. That she had always kept him from naming it more\n",
       "definitely was a feat for which, she well knew it, she could allow herself\n",
       "some credit. Not only had it needed, at some moments, dexterity; it had\n",
       "needed, at others, self-control. Self-control, however, was habitual\n",
       "to her. She had long since schooled herself into the acceptance of her\n",
       "stupidly maimed life, seeing herself in no pathetic similes at all, but,\n",
       "rather, as a foolish, unformed creature who, partly through blindness,\n",
       "partly through recklessness, had managed badly to cripple herself at the\n",
       "outset of life's walk, and who must make the best of a hop-skip-and-jump\n",
       "gait for the rest of it. She had felt, when she decided that she had a\n",
       "right to live away from Everard, that she had no right to ask more of\n",
       "fortune than that escape, that freedom. One paid for such freedom by\n",
       "limiting one's possibilities, and she had never hesitated to pay. Never to\n",
       "indulge herself in sentimental repinings or in sentimental musings, never\n",
       "to indulge others in sentimental relationships, had been the most obvious\n",
       "sort of payment; and if, in regard to Sir Basil, the payment had sometimes\n",
       "been difficult, the reward had been that sense of unblemished peace, that\n",
       "sense of composure and gaiety. It was enough to know, as a justification\n",
       "of her success, that she made him happy, not unhappy. It was enough to\n",
       "know that she could own freely to herself how much she cared for him, so\n",
       "much that, finding him funny, dear, and dull, she was far fonder of his\n",
       "funniness, of his dullness, than of other people's cleverness. He made\n",
       "her feel as if, on that maimed, that rather hot and jaded walk, she had\n",
       "come upon the great oak-tree and sat down to rest in its peaceful shadow,\n",
       "hearing it rustle happily over her and knowing that it was secure strength\n",
       "she leaned against, knowing that the happy rustle was for her, because she\n",
       "was there, peaceful and confident. So it had all been like a gift, a sad,\n",
       "sweet secret that one must not listen to except with blindfolded eyes. She\n",
       "had never allowed the gift to become a burden or a peril. And now, to-day,\n",
       "for the first time, it was as though she could raise the bandage and look\n",
       "at him.\n",
       "\n",
       "She sat beside him in her widow's enfranchising blackness and she couldn't\n",
       "but seer at last, how deep was that upwelling, inevitable fondness. So\n",
       "deep that, gazing, as if with new and dazzled eyes, she wondered a little\n",
       "giddily over the long self-mastery; so deep that she almost felt it as a\n",
       "strange, unreal tribute to trivial circumstance that, without delay, she\n",
       "should not lean her head against the dear oak and tell it, at last, that\n",
       "its shelter was all that she asked of life. It was necessary to banish\n",
       "the vision by the firm turning to that other, that dark one, of her dead\n",
       "husband, her grief-stricken child, and, in looking, she knew that while it\n",
       "was so near she could not dwell on the possibilities of freedom. So she\n",
       "talked with her friend, able to smile, able, once or twice, to use toward\n",
       "him her more intimate tone of affectionate playfulness.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But you are coming back--directly!\" Sir Basil exclaimed, when she told him\n",
       "that she expected her boy in a few days and that they would sail for New\n",
       "York together.\n",
       "\n",
       "Not directly, she answered. Before very long, she hoped. So many things\n",
       "depended on Imogen.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But she will live with you now, over here.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I don't think that she will want to leave America,\" said Valerie. \"I don't\n",
       "think, even, that I want her to.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But this is your home, now,\" Sir Basil protested, looking about, as though\n",
       "for evidences of the assertion, at the intimate comforts of the room. \"You\n",
       "know that you are more at home here than there.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not now. My home, now, is Imogen's.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Basil appeared to reflect, and then to put aside reflection as, after\n",
       "all, inapplicable, as yet, to the situation.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, I must pay America a visit,\" he said with an unemphatic smile. \"I've\n",
       "not been there for twenty years, you know. I'll like seeing it again, and\n",
       "seeing you--in Miss Imogen's home.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie again flushed a little. In some matters Sir Basil was anything but\n",
       "dull, and his throwing, now, of the bridge was most tactfully done. He\n",
       "intended that she should see it solidly spanning the distance between them\n",
       "and only time was needed, she knew, to give him his right of walking over\n",
       "it, and her right--but that was one of the visions she must not look at.\n",
       "A great many things lay between now and then, confused, anxious, perhaps\n",
       "painful, things. The figure of Imogen so filled the immediate future that\n",
       "the place where Sir Basil should take up his thread was blotted into an\n",
       "almost melancholy haze of distance. But it was good to feel the bridge\n",
       "there, to know him so swift and so sure.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She is very clever, your girl, isn't she? I've always felt it from what\n",
       "you've told me,\" he said, defining for himself, as she saw, the future\n",
       "where they were to meet.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very, I think.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very learned and artistic. I'm afraid she'll find me an awful Philistine.\n",
       "You must stand up for me with her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I will,\" Valerie smiled, adding, \"but Imogen is very pretty, too, you\n",
       "know.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, I know; one can see that in the photographs,\" said Sir Basil. There\n",
       "were several of these standing about the room and he get up to look at\n",
       "them, one after the other--Imogen in evening, in day dress, all showing her\n",
       "erect slenderness, her crown of hair, her large, calm eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She looks kind but very cool, you know,\" he commented. \"She would take one\n",
       "in at a great rate; not find much use for an every-day person like me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, you won't be an every-day person to Imogen. And her great point, I\n",
       "think, is her finding a use for everybody.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Making them useful to her?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No--to themselves--to the world in general.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Improving them, do you mean?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, yes, I should say that was more it. She likes to give people a\n",
       "lift.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But--she's so very young. How does she manage it?\" Sir Basil queried over\n",
       "the photograph, whose eyes dwelt on him while he spoke,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, you'll see,\" Valerie smiled a little at his pertinacity. \"I've no\n",
       "doubt that she will improve you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well,\" said Sir Basil, recognizing her jocund intention, \"she's welcome\n",
       "to try. As long as you are there to see that she isn't too hard on me.\" He\n",
       "dismissed Imogen, then, from his sight and thoughts, replacing her on the\n",

       "with such sweetness of the help that he would give her if he could be with\n",
       "her in her long, cold waiting, that, with touched delight, he found himself\n",
       "in the position of a friend so trusted, so leaned upon, that he could\n",

       "grotesque splendor of the giant city, the glory, the ugliness of the\n",
       "country he loved, the country that made giant-like, grotesque cities, and\n",
       "that made Imogens.\n",
       "\n",
       "She was the flower of it all--the flower and the so much more than flower.\n",
       "He didn't care a fig, so he told himself, about the mere fact of her being\n",
       "beautiful, finished, in her long black furs, her face so white, her hair so\n",
       "gold under her little hat. She wasn't to be picked and placed high, above\n",
       "the swarming ugliness. No, and that was why he cared for her when he had\n",
       "ceased to care for so many pretty girls--her roots were deep; she shared\n",
       "her loveliness; she gave; she opened; she did not shut away. She was the\n",
       "promise for many rather than the guerdon of the few. Jack's democracy was\n",
       "the ripe fruit of an ancestry of high endeavor and high responsibility. The\n",
       "service of impersonal ends was in his blood, and no meaner task had ever\n",
       "been asked of him or of a long line of forebears. He had never in his own\n",
       "person experienced ugliness; it remained a picture, seen but not felt by\n",
       "him, so that it was not difficult for him to see it with the eyes of faith\n",
       "as glorified and uplifted. It constituted a splendid burden, an ennobling\n",
       "duty, for those who possessed beauty, and without that grave and happy\n",
       "right to serve, beauty itself would lose all meaning. He often talked about\n",
       "democracy to Imogen. She understood what he felt about it more firmly, more\n",
       "surely, than he himself did; for, where he sometimes suspected himself of\n",
       "theory, she acted. She, too, rejoiced in the fundamental sameness of the\n",
       "human family that banded it together in, essentially, the same great\n",
       "adventure--the adventure of the soul.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen understood; Imogen rejoiced; Imogen was bound on that adventure--not\n",
       "only with him, but, and it was this that gave those wide wings to his\n",
       "feeling for her, with _them_--with all the vast brotherhood of humanity.\n",
       "Now and then, to be sure, faint echoes in her of her father, touches of\n",
       "youthful assurance, youthful grandiloquence, stirred the young man's sense\n",

       "showed her limitations as symptoms of an influence that, in its foolish\n",
       "aspects, he would not have had her too clearly recognize; her beautiful,\n",
       "filial devotion more than compensated for her filial blindness--nay,\n",
       "sanctified it; and her heavenly face had but to turn on him for him to\n",
       "envelop all her little solemnities and importances in a comprehending\n",
       "reverence. Jack thought Imogen's face very heavenly. He was an artist by\n",
       "profession, as we have said, taking himself rather seriously, too, but the\n",
       "artistic perception was so strongly colored by ethical and intellectual\n",
       "preoccupations that the spontaneous satisfaction in the Eternal Now of mere\n",
       "beauty was rarely his. Certainly he saw the flower-like texture of Imogen's\n",
       "skin; the way in which the light azured its whiteness and slid upon its\n",
       "child-like surfaces. He saw the long oval of the face, the firm and gentle\n",
       "lips, drawn with a delicate amplitude, the broad hazel eyes set under\n",
       "a level sweep of dark eyebrow and outlined, not shadowed, so clear, so\n",
       "wide they were, by the dark lashes. But all the fresh loveliness of line,\n",
       "surface, color, remained an intellectual appreciation; while what touched,\n",
       "what penetrated, were the analogies she suggested, the lovely soul that the\n",
       "lovely face vouched for. The oval of her face and the charming squaring\n",
       "of her eyes, so candid, so unmysterious, made him think of a Botticelli\n",
       "Madonna; and her long, narrow hands, with their square finger-tips, might\n",
       "have been the hands of a Botticelli angel holding a votive offering of\n",
       "fruit and flowers. His mind seldom rested in her beauty, passing at once\n",
       "through it to what it expressed of purity, strength and serenity. It\n",
       "expressed so much of these that he had never paused at the portals, as it\n",
       "were, to feel the defects of her face. Imogen's nose was too small; neat\n",
       "rather than beautiful. Her eyes, with the porcelain-like quality of their\n",
       "white, the jewel-like color of their irises, were over-large; and when\n",
       "she smiled, which she did often, though with more gentleness than gaiety,\n",
       "she showed an over-spacious expanse of large white teeth. For the rest,\n",
       "Imogen's figure was that of the typical well-groomed, well-trained,\n",
       "American girl, long-limbed, slender, rounded; in her carriage a girlish\n",
       "air of consciousness; the poise of her broad shoulders and slender hips\n",
       "expressing at once hygienic and fashionable ideals that reproved slack\n",
       "gaits and outlines. As they walked, as they talked, watching the slow\n",
       "advance of the great steamer; as their eyes rested calmly and intelligently\n",
       "on each other, one could see that the girl's relation to this dear friend\n",
       "was untouched by any trace of coquetry and that his feeling for her, if\n",
       "deep, was under most perfect control.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It's over a year, now, since I saw mama,\" Imogen was saying, as they\n",
       "turned again from a long scrutiny of the crowded decks--the distance was as\n",
       "yet too great for individual recognition. \"She didn't come over this summer\n",
       "as usual,--poor dear, how bitterly she must regret that now, though it was\n",
       "hardly her fault, papa and I fixed on our Western trip for the summer. It\n",
       "seems a very long time to me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And to me,\" said Jack. \"It's only a year since I came really to know you;\n",
       "but how much longer it seems than that.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It's strange that we should know each other so well and yet that you have\n",
       "never seen my mother,\" said Imogen. \"Is that she? No, she is not so tall.\n",
       "Poor darling, how tired and sad she must be.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are tired and sad, too,\" said Jack.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, but I am young--youth can bear so much better. And, besides, I don't\n",
       "think that my sadness would ever be like mama's. You see, in a way, I have\n",
       "so much more in my life. I should never sit down in my sadness and let it\n",
       "overwhelm me. I should use it, always. It is strange that grief should so\n",
       "often make people selfish. It ought, rather, to open doors for us and give\n",
       "us wider visions.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He was so sure that it had performed these offices for her, looking, as he\n",
       "now looked, at her delicate profile, turned from him while she gazed toward\n",
       "the ship, that he was barely conscious of the little tremor of amusement\n",
       "that went through him for the triteness of her speech. Such triteness was\n",
       "beautiful when it expressed such reality.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I suppose that you will count for more, now, in your mother's life,\" he\n",
       "said,--that Imogen should, seemingly, have counted for so little had been\n",
       "the frequent subject of his indignant broodings. \"She will make you her\n",
       "object.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen smiled a little. \"Isn't it more likely that I shall make her mine?\n",
       "one of mine? But you don't know mama yet. She is, in a way, very\n",
       "lovely--but so much of a child. So much younger--it seems funny to say it,\n",
       "but it's true--than I am.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Littler,\" Jack amended, \"not younger.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But Imogen, while accepting the amendment, wouldn't accept the negation.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Both, I'm afraid,\" she sighed.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Will she like it over here?\" Jack mused more than questioned.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Hardly, since she has always lived as little here as she could manage.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perhaps she will want to take you back to England,\" he surmised,\n",
       "conscious, while he spoke the almost humorous words, of a very firm\n",
       "determination that she shouldn't do so.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen paused in her walk at this, fixing upon him eyes very grave indeed.\n",
       "\"Take me back to England? Do you really think that I would consent to that?\n",
       "Surely you know me better, Jack?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I think I do. Only you might yield against your will, if she insisted.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Surely you know me well enough to know that I would never yield against my\n",
       "will, if I knew that my will was right. I might sacrifice a great deal for\n",
       "mama--I am prepared to--but never that; Never,\" Imogen repeated. \"There are\n",
       "some things that one must not sacrifice. Her living in England is a whim;\n",
       "my living in my own country is part of my religion.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I know, of course, dear Imogen. But,\" Jack was argumentative, \"as to\n",
       "sacrifice, say that it was asked of you, by right. Say, for instance, that\n",
       "you married a man who had to take you out of your own country?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She smiled a little at the stupid surmise. \"That hardly applies. Besides, I\n",
       "would never marry a man who was not one of my own people, who was not a\n",
       "part--as I am a part--of the Whole I live for. My life is here, all its\n",
       "meaning is here--you know it--just as yours is.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I love to know it--I was only teasing you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He loved to know it, of course. Yet, while it answered to all his own\n",
       "theories that the person should be so much less to her than the idea the\n",
       "person lived for, he couldn't but feel at times, with a rueful sense of\n",
       "unworthiness, that this rare capacity in her might apply in most unwelcome\n",
       "fashion to his own case. In Jack, the deep wells of feeling and emotion\n",
       "were barred and bolted over by a whole complicated system of reticences;\n",
       "by a careful sense of responsibility, not only toward others, but toward\n",
       "himself; by a disciplined self-control that was a second nature. But, he\n",
       "could see it well enough, if such, deep wells there were in Imogen, they,\n",
       "as yet, were in no need of barring and bolting. Her eyes could show a quiet\n",
       "acceptance of homage, a placid conviction of power, a tender sympathy, but\n",
       "the depth and trouble of emotion was not yet in them. He often suspected\n",
       "that he was nearer to her when he talked to her of causes than when he\n",
       "ventured, now and then, to talk about his feelings. There was always the\n",
       "uncomfortable surmise that the man who could offer a more equipped faculty\n",
       "for the adventure of the soul, might altogether outdistance him with\n",
       "Imogen. By any emotion, any appeal or passion that he might show, she would\n",
       "remain, so his intuition at moments told him, quite unbiased; while she\n",
       "weighed simply worth against worth, and weight--in the sense of strength of\n",
       "soul--against weight. And it was this intuition that made self-control and\n",
       "reticence easier than they might otherwise have been. His theories might\n",
       "assure him that such integrity of purpose was magnificent; his manly\n",
       "common-sense told him that in a wife one wanted to be sure of the taint of\n",
       "personal preference; so that, while he knew that he would never need to\n",
       "weigh Imogen's worth against anybody else's, he watched and waited until\n",
       "some unawakened capacity in her should be able happily to respond to the\n",
       "more human aspects of life. Meanwhile the steamer had softly glided into\n",
       "the dock and the two young people at last descried upon the crowded decks\n",
       "the tall, familiar figure of Eddy Upton, like Imogen in his fairness,\n",
       "clearness, but with a more masculine jut of nose and chin, sharper lines of\n",
       "brow and cheek and lip. And beside Eddy--Jack hardly needed the controlled\n",
       "quiet of Imogen's \"There's mama\" to identify the figure in black.\n",
       "\n",
       "She leaned there, high and far, on the deck of the great steamer that\n",
       "loomed above their heads, almost ominous in its gigantic bulk and darkness;\n",
       "she leaned there against the rosy sky, her face intent, searching, bent\n",
       "upon the fluttering, shouting throng beneath; and for Jack, in this first\n",
       "impression of her, before she had yet found Imogen, there was something\n",
       "pathetic in the earnestness of her searching gaze, something that softened\n",
       "the rigors of his disapprobation. But, already, too, he fancied that he\n",
       "caught the expected note of the frivolous in the outline of her fur-lined\n",
       "coat, in the grace of her little hat.\n",
       "\n",
       "Still she sought, her face pale and grave, while, with an imperceptible\n",
       "movement, the steamer glided forward, and now, as Imogen raised her muff\n",
       "in a long, steady wave, her eyes at last found her daughter and, smiling,\n",
       "smiling eagerly down upon them, she leaned far over the deck to wave her\n",
       "answer. She put her hand on her son's arm, pointing them out to him, and\n",
       "Eddy, also finding them, smiled too, but with his rather cool kindness,\n",
       "raising his hat and giving Jack a recognizing nod. It was then as if he\n",
       "introduced Jack. Jack saw her question, saw him assent, and her smile went\n",
       "from Imogen to him enveloping him with its mild radiance.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She is very lovely, your mother, as you say,\" Jack commented, feeling a\n",
       "little breathless over this silent meeting of forces that he must think of\n",
       "as hostile, and finding nothing better to say.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen, who had continued steadily to wave her muff, welcoming, but for her\n",
       "part unsmiling, answered, \"Yes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I hope that she won't mind my being here, in the way, after a fashion,\"\n",
       "said Jack.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She won't mind,\" said Imogen.\n",
       "\n",
       "He knew the significance of her voice; displeasure was in its gentleness,\n",
       "a quiet endurance of distress. It struck him then, in a moment, that it\n",
       "was rather out of place for Mrs. Upton to smile so radiantly at such a\n",
       "home-coming. Not that the smile had been a gay one. It had shone out after\n",
       "her search for her daughter's face; for the finding of it and for him it\n",
       "had continued to shine. It was like sunlight on a sad white day of mist; it\n",
       "did not dispel mournfulness, it seemed only to irradiate it. But--to have\n",
       "smiled at all. With Imogen's eyes he saw, suddenly, that tears would have\n",
       "been the more appropriate greeting and, in looking back at the girl once\n",
       "more, he saw that her own, as if in vicarious atonement, were running down\n",
       "her cheeks. She, then, felt a doubled suffering and his heart hardened\n",
       "against the woman who had caused it.\n",
       "\n",
       "The two travelers had disappeared and the decks were filled with the\n",
       "jostling hurry of final departure. Jack and Imogen moved to take their\n",
       "places by the long gangway that slanted up from the dock.\n",
       "\n",
       "He said nothing to her of her tears, silent before this subtle grief;\n",
       "perhaps, for all his love and sympathy, a little disconcerted by its\n",
       "demonstration, and it was Imogen who spoke, murmuring, as they stood\n",
       "together, looking up, \"Poor, poor papa.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Yes, that had been the hurt, to see her dead put aside, almost forgotten,\n",
       "in the mother's over-facile smile.\n",
       "\n",
       "The passengers came trooping down the gangway, with an odd buoyancy of step\n",
       "caused by the steep incline, and Jack, for all his expectancy, had eyes,\n",
       "appreciative and critical, for the procession of his country-people. Stout,\n",
       "short men, embodying purely economic functions, with rudimentary features,\n",
       "slightly embossed, as it were, upon pouch-like faces. Thin, young men,\n",
       "whose lean countenances had somewhat the aspect of steely machinery, apt\n",
       "for swift, ruthless, utilitarian processes. Bloodless old men, many of\n",
       "whom looked like withered, weary children adorned with whitened hair.\n",
       "The average manhood of America, with its general air of cheap and hasty\n",
       "growth, but varied here and there by a higher type; an athletic collegian,\n",
       "auspiciously Grecian in length of limb, width of brow, deep placidity\n",

       "firmly on the surface that she was so kind. He watched her face with\n",
       "wonder, and a little fear, for which he was angry with himself. He noted\n",
       "the three _grains de beauté_ and the smile that seemed to break high on\n",

       "She frightened him, made him feel shy, yet made him feel at ease, too,\n",

       "She was simple, she was gliding; but she was not near.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"May I come in soon and see you?\" he said to Imogen while they paused at\n",
       "the foot of the stone steps. And, with at last her own smile, sad but\n",

       "time, as he told himself, to get used to each other's excesses or lacks of\n",
       "grief. And as he waited for Imogen in the long drawing-room that had been\n",
       "the setting of so many of their communings, he wondered what adjustment the\n",
       "mother and daughter had come to.\n",
       "\n",
       "The aspect of the drawing-room was unchanged; changelessness had always\n",
       "been for him its characteristic mark; in essentials, he felt sure, it had\n",
       "not changed since the days of old Mrs. Upton, the present Mrs. Upton's long\n",
       "deceased mother-in-law. Only a touch here and there showed the passage of\n",
       "time. It was continuous with the dining-room, so that it was but one long\n",
       "room that crossed all the depth of the house, tall windows at the back,\n",
       "heavily draped, echoing dimly the windows of the front that looked out\n",
       "upon the snowy, glittering street. The inner half could be shut away by\n",
       "folding-doors, and its highly polished sideboard, chairs, table, a silver\n",
       "épergne towering upon it, glimmered in a dusky element that relegated\n",
       "it, when not illuminated for use, to a mere ghostly decorativeness.\n",
       "By contrast, the drawing-room was vivid. Its fringed and buttoned\n",
       "furniture,--crimson brocade set in a dark carved wood, the dangling lusters\n",
       "of the huge chandelier, the elaborate Sèvres vases on the mantelpiece,\n",
       "flanking a bronze clock portentously gloomy, expressed old Mrs. Upton's\n",
       "richly solid ideals; but these permanent uglinesses distressed Jack less\n",
       "than the pompous and complacent taste of the later additions. A pretentious\n",
       "cabinet of late Italian Renaissance work stood in a corner; the dark marble\n",
       "mantelpiece, that looked like a sarcophagus, was incongruously draped with\n",
       "an embroidered Italian cope, and a pseudo-Correggio Madonna, encompassed\n",
       "with a wilderness of gilt frame, smiled a pseudo-smile from the embossed\n",
       "paper of the walls. It was one of Jack's little trials to hear Imogen refer\n",
       "to this trophy with placid conviction.\n",
       "\n",
       "Yet, for all its solemn stupidity, the room was not altogether unpleasing;\n",
       "it signified something, were it only an indifference to fashion, It was,\n",
       "funnily, almost Spartan, for all the carving, the cushioning, the crimson,\n",
       "so little concession did it make to other people's standards or to small,\n",
       "happy minor uses. Mr. Upton and his daughter had not changed it because\n",
       "they had other things to think of; and they thought of these things not in\n",
       "the drawing-room but in the large library up-stairs. There one could find\n",
       "the personal touches, that, but for the cope, the cabinet, the Correggio,\n",
       "were lacking below. There the many photographs from the Italian primitives,\n",
       "the many gracious Donatello and Delia Robbia bas-reliefs, expressed\n",
       "something of Imogen, too, though Jack always felt that Imogen's esthetic;\n",
       "side expressed what was not very essential in her.\n",
       "\n",
       "While he waited now, he had paused at last before two portraits. He had\n",
       "often so paused while waiting for Imogen. To-night it was with a new\n",
       "curiosity.\n",
       "\n",
       "They hung opposite the Correggio and on either side of the great mirror\n",
       "that rose from the mantelpiece to the cornice. One was of a young man\n",
       "dressed in the fashion of twenty-five years before, dressed with a rather\n",
       "self-conscious negligence. He was pale, earnest, handsome, though his nose\n",
       "was too small and his eyes too large. A touch of the histrionic was in\n",
       "his attitude, in his dark hair, tossed carelessly, in the unnecessarily\n",
       "weighty and steady look of his dark eyes, even in the slight smile of\n",
       "his firm, full lips, a smile too well-adapted, as it were, to the needs\n",
       "of any interlocutor. Beneath his arm was a book; a long, distinguished\n",
       "hand hanging slackly. Jack turned away with a familiar impatience. In\n",
       "twenty-five years Mr. Upton had changed very little. It was much the same\n",
       "face that he had known; in especial, the slack, self-conscious hand, the\n",
       "smile--always so much more for himself than for you--were familiar. The\n",
       "hand, the necktie, the smile, so deep, so dark, so empty, were all, Jack\n",
       "was inclined to suspect, that there had ever been of Mr. Upton.\n",
       "\n",
       "The other portrait, painted with the sleek convention of that earlier\n",
       "epoch, was of a woman in a ball-dress. The portrait was by a French master\n",
       "and under his brush the sitter had taken on the look of a Feuillet heroine.\n",
       "She was gay, languid, sentimental, and extraordinarily pretty. Her hair was\n",
       "dressed in a bygone fashion, drawn smoothly up from the little ears, coiled\n",
       "high and falling across her forehead in a light, straight fringe. Her\n",
       "wonderful white shoulders rose from a wonderfully low white bodice; a\n",
       "bracelet of emeralds was on her arm, a spray of jasmine in her fingers;\n",
       "she was evidently a girl, yet in her apparel was a delicate splendor, in\n",
       "her gaze a candid assurance, that marked her as an American girl. And she\n",
       "expressed charmingly, with sincerity as it were, a frivolous convention.\n",
       "This was Miss Cray, a year or so before her marriage with Mr. Upton. The\n",
       "portrait had been painted in Paris, where, orphaned, lovely, but not\n",
       "largely dowered, she had, under the wing of an aunt domiciled in France\n",
       "for many years and bearing one of its oldest names, failed to make the\n",
       "brilliant match that had been hoped for her. This touch of France in\n",
       "girlhood echoed an earlier impress. Imogen had told him that her mother\n",
       "had been educated for some years in a French convent, deposited there\n",
       "by pleasure-loving parents during European wanderings, and Imogen had\n",
       "intimated that her mother's frequent returns to her native land had never\n",
       "quite effaced alien and regrettable points of view. Before this portrait,\n",
       "Jack was accustomed, not to impatience, but to a gaze of rather ironic\n",
       "comprehension. It had always explained to him so much. But to-night he\n",
       "found himself looking at it with an intentness in which was a touched\n",
       "curiosity; in which, also, and once more he was vexed with himself for\n",
       "feeling it, was an anxiety, almost a fear. Of course it hadn't been like,\n",
       "even then, he was surer than ever of that to-night, with his memory of the\n",
       "pale face smiling down at him and at Imogen from the deck of the great\n",
       "steamer. The painter had seen the mask only; even then there had been more\n",
       "to see. And sure, as he had never been before, of all that there must have\n",
       "been besides to see, he wondered with a new wonder how she had come to\n",
       "marry Mr. Upton.\n",
       "\n",
       "He glanced back at him. Handsome? Yes. Distinguished? Yes; there was no\n",
       "trace of the shoddy in his spiritual histrionics. He had been fired by\n",
       "love, no doubt, far beyond his own chill complacency. Such a butterfly\n",
       "girl, falling with, perhaps, bruised wings from the high, hard glare of\n",
       "worldly ambitions, more of others for her than her own for herself--of that\n",
       "he felt, also quite newly sure to-night--such a girl had thought Mr. Upton,\n",
       "no doubt, a very noble creature and herself happy and fortunate. And she\n",
       "had been very young.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was still looking up at Miss Cray when Imogen came in. He felt sure,\n",
       "from his first glance at her, that nothing had happened, during the\n",
       "interval of his abstention, to deepen her distress. In her falling and\n",
       "folding black she was serene and the look of untroubled force he knew so\n",
       "well was in her eyes. She had taken the measure of the grown-up butterfly\n",
       "and found it easy of management. He felt with relief that the mother could\n",
       "have threatened none of the things they held dear. And, indeed, in his\n",
       "imagination, her spirit seemed to flutter over them in the solid, solemn\n",
       "room, reassuring through its very lightness and purposelessness.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am so glad to see you,\" Imogen said, after she had shaken his hand and\n",
       "they had seated themselves on the sofa that stretched along the wall under\n",
       "the Correggio. \"I have been sorry about the other day.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh!\" he answered vaguely, not quite sure for what the regret was.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I ought to have mastered myself; been more able to play the trivial part,\n",
       "as you did; that was such real kindness in you, Jack, dear. I couldn't have\n",
       "pretended gaiety, but I didn't intend to cast a gloom. It only became that,\n",
       "I suppose, when I was--so hurt.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He understood now. \"By there not being gloom enough?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"If you like to put it so. To see her smile like that!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack was sorry for her, yet, at the same time, sorry for the butterfly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, I know how you must have felt. But, it was natural, you know. One\n",
       "smiles involuntarily at a meeting, however sad its background. I believe\n",
       "that _you_ would have smiled if she hadn't.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen's clear eyes were upon him while he thus shared with her his sense\n",
       "of mitigations and she answered without a pause: \"Yes, I could have smiled\n",
       "at her. That would have been different.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You mean--that you had a right to smile?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I can't see how she _could_,\" said Imogen in a low voice, not answering\n",
       "his question; thinking, probably, that it answered itself. And she went on:\n",
       "\"I was ready, you know, to help her to bear it all, with my whole strength;\n",
       "but, and it is that that still hurts me so, she doesn't seem to know that\n",
       "she needs help. She doesn't seem to be bearing anything.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack was silent, feeling here that they skirted too closely ground upon\n",
       "which, with Imogen, he never ventured. He had brought from his study of the\n",
       "portraits a keener sense of how much Mrs. Upton had to bear no longer.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But,\" Imogen continued, oddly echoing his own sense of deeper insights, \"I\n",
       "already understand her so much better than I've ever done. I've never come\n",
       "so near. Never seen so clearly how little there is to see. She's still\n",
       "essentially that, you know,\" and she pointed to the French portrait that,\n",
       "with softly, prettily mournful eyes, gazed out at them.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The butterfly thing,\" Jack suggested rather than acquiesced.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The butterfly thing,\" she accepted.\n",
       "\n",
       "But Jack went on: \"Not only that, though. There is, I'm very sure, more to\n",
       "see. She is so--so sensible.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Sensible?\" again Imogen accepted. \"Well, isn't that portrait sensible?\n",
       "Doesn't that lovely, luxurious girl see and want all the happy, the easy\n",
       "things of life? It is sensible, of course, clearly to know what they are,\n",
       "and firmly to make for them. That's just what I recognize now in her, that\n",
       "all she wants is to make things easy, to _glisser_.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, I can believe that,\" he murmured, a little dazed by her clear\n",
       "decisiveness; he often felt Imogen to be so much more clear-sighted, so\n",
       "much more clever than himself when it came to judgments and insights, that\n",
       "he could only at the moment acquiesce, through helplessness. \"I suppose\n",
       "that is the essential--the desire of ease.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And it hurts you that I should be able to see it, to say it, of my\n",
       "mother.\" Her eyes, with no hardness, no reproach, probed him, too. She\n",
       "almost made him feel unworthy of the trust she showed him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No,\" he said, smiling at her, \"because I know that it's only to a friend\n",
       "who so understands you, who so cares for all that comes into your life.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Only to such a friend, indeed,\" she returned gently.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Have they been hard, these days?\" he asked her, atoning to himself for the\n",
       "momentary shrinking that she had detected.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, they have,\" she answered, \"and the more so from my seeing all her\n",
       "efforts to keep them soft; as if it was ease _I_ wanted! But I have faced\n",
       "it all.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "far enough to form any sort of a bulwark. A cheerful, smiling, hard young\n",
       "pagan, Eddy, frankly bored by his father, coolly fond of his mother,\n",
       "avoiding the one, but capable of little effective demonstration toward the\n",
       "other. Eddy liked achievement, exactitude, a serene, smiling outlook, and\n",
       "was happily absorbed in his own interests.\n",
       "\n",
       "So it had all gone on,--Imogen traced it, sitting there in her quiet\n",
       "corner, holding balances in fair, firm hands,--her mother drifting into a\n",
       "place of mere conventionality in the family life; and Imogen, even now,\n",
       "could not see quite clearly whether it had been she who had judged and\n",
       "abandoned her husband, or he who had judged and put her aside. In either\n",
       "case she could sum it up, her eyes lifted once more to the portrait's\n",
       "steady eyes, with, \"Poor, wonderful papa.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He was gone, the dear, the wonderful one, and she was left single-handed\n",
       "to carry on his work. What this work was loomed largely, though vaguely,\n",
       "for her. The three slender volumes, literary and ethical, were the only\n",
       "permanent testament that her father had given to the world; and dealing, as\n",
       "in the main they did, with ultimate problems, their keynote an illumined\n",
       "democracy that saw in most of the results as yet achieved by his country a\n",
       "base travesty of the doctrine, the largeness of their grasp was perhaps a\n",
       "trifle loose. Imogen did not see it. Her appreciation was more of aims than\n",
       "of achievements; but she felt that her father's writings were the body,\n",
       "only, of his message; its spirit lived--lived in herself and in all those\n",
       "with whom he had come in fruitful--contact. It was to hand on the meaning\n",
       "of that spirit that she felt herself dedicated. Perfect, unflinching truth;\n",
       "the unfaltering bearing witness to all men of his conception of right;\n",
       "the seeing of her own personality as but an instrument in the service of\n",
       "good--these were the chief words of the gospel. Life in its realest sense\n",
       "meant only this dedication. To serve, to love, to be the truth. Her eyes\n",
       "on her father's pictured eyes, Imogen smiled into them, promising him and\n",
       "herself that she would not fail.\n",

       "It was in the library next morning that Valerie asked Imogen to join her,\n",
       "and the girl, who had come into the room with her light, soft step, paused\n",
       "to kiss her mother's forehead before going to the opposite seat.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Deep in ways and means, mamma dear?\" she asked her. \"Why, you are quite\n",
       "a business woman.\" \"Quite,\" Valerie replied. \"I have been going over\n",
       "things with Mr. Haliwell, you know.\" She smiled thoughtfully at Imogen,\n",
       "preoccupied, as the girl could see, by what she had to say.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen was slightly ruffled by the flavor of assurance that she felt in\n",
       "her mother, as of someone who, after gently and vaguely fumbling about for\n",
       "a clue to her own meaning in new conditions, had suddenly found something\n",
       "to which she held very firmly. Imogen was rejoiced for her that she\n",
       "should find a field of real usefulness-were it only that of housekeeping\n",
       "and seeing to weekly bills; but there was certainly a touch of the\n",
       "inappropriate, perhaps of the grotesque, in any assumption on her mother's\n",
       "part of maturity and competence. She therefore smiled back at her with\n",
       "much the same tolerantly interested smile that a parent might bestow on a\n",
       "child's brick-building of a castle.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I'm so glad that you have that to give yourself to, mama dear,\" she said.\n",
       "\"You shall most certainly be our business woman and add figures and keep\n",
       "an eye on investment to your heart's content. I know absolutely nothing of\n",
       "the technical side of money--I've thought of it only as an instrument, a\n",
       "responsibility, a power given me in trust for others.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie, whose warmth of tint and softness of outline seemed dimmed and\n",
       "sharpened, as though by a controlled anxiety, glanced at her daughter,\n",
       "gravely and a little timidly. And as, in silence, she lightly dotted her\n",
       "pen over the paper under her hand, uncertain, apparently, with what words\n",
       "to approach the subject, it was Imogen, again, who spoke, kindly, but with\n",
       "a touch of impatience.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We mustn't be too long over our talk, dear. I must meet Miss Bocock at\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Miss Bocock?\" Valerie was vague. \"Have I met her?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not yet. She is a _protégée_ of mine--English--a Newnham woman--a\n",
       "folk-lorist. I heard of her from some Boston friends, read her books, and\n",
       "induced her to come over and lecture to us this winter. We are arranging\n",
       "about the lectures now. I've got up a big class for her--when I say 'I,' I\n",
       "mean, of course, with the help of all my dear, good friends who are always\n",
       "so ready to back me up in my undertakings. She is an immensely interesting\n",
       "woman; ugly, dresses tastelessly; but one doesn't think of that when one is\n",
       "listening to her. She has a wonderful mind; strong, disciplined,\n",
       "stimulating. I'm very happy that I've been able to give America to her and\n",
       "her to America.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She must be very interesting,\" said Valerie. \"I shall like hearing her. We\n",
       "will get through our business as soon as possible so that you may keep your\n",
       "appointment.\" And now, after this digression, she seemed to find it easier\n",
       "to plunge. \"You knew that your father had left very little money, Imogen.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen, her hands lightly folded in her lap, sat across the table, all mild\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Papa considered himself only a steward for what he had. He used his money,\n",

       "accumulations of capital, against all private property, unless used for the\n",
       "benefit of all, was very strong.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes,\" said Valerie, after a slight pause, in which she did not raise her\n",
       "eyes from the paper where her pen now drew a few neat lines. \"Yes. But\n",
       "he has left very little for Eddy, very little for you; it was that I was\n",

       "\n",

       "upbringing of a man. You have the European standpoint; we don't hold with\n",
       "that over here. We believe in equipping the man, giving him power for\n",
       "independence, and we expect him to make his own way. Papa would rather have\n",

       "\n",
       "Valerie drew her lines into a square before saying, \"I, you know, with Mr.\n",

       "great deal.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh, I know that you couldn't well do that!\" said Imogen with a smile a\n",
       "little bitter. \"I spent very little on myself.\" And she continued, with\n",
       "somewhat the manner of humoring an exacting child: \"You see, I helped a\n",
       "great many people; I sent two girls to college; I sent a boy--such a dear,\n",
       "fine boy--for three years' art-study in Paris; he is getting on so well.\n",
       "There is my girls' club on the East side, my girls' club in Vermont; there\n",
       "is the Crippled Children's Home,--quite numberless charities I'm interested\n",
       "in. It's been one thing after another, money has not lacked,--but time has,\n",
       "to answer all the claims upon me. And then,\" here Imogen smiled again,\n",
       "\"I believe in the claims of the self, too, when they are disciplined\n",
       "and harmonized into a larger experience. There has been music to keep\n",
       "up; friends to see and to make things nice for; flowers to send to sick\n",
       "friends; concerts to send poor friends to; dinners and lunches to give so\n",
       "that friends may meet--all the thousand and one little things that a large,\n",
       "rich life demands of one.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, yes,\" said Valerie, who had nodded at intervals during the list.\n",
       "\"I quite see all that. You are a dear, generous child and love to give\n",
       "pleasure; and your father refused you nothing. It's my fault, too. My more\n",
       "mercenary mind should have been near to keep watch. Because, as a, result,\n",
       "there's very little, dear, very, very little.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, your being here would not have changed our ideas as to the right way\n",
       "to spend money, mama. Don't blame yourself for that. We should have bled\n",
       "_you_, too!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, no, you wouldn't,\" Valerie said quickly. \"I've too much of the\n",
       "instinctive, selfish mother-thing in me to have allowed myself to be bled\n",
       "for cripples and clubs and artistic boys. I don't care about them a bit\n",
       "compared to you and Eddy. But this is all beside the mark. The question now\n",
       "is, What are we to do? Because that generous, expensive life of yours has\n",
       "come to an end, for the present at all events.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen at this sat silent for some moments, fixing eyes of deep, and\n",
       "somewhat confused, cogitation upon her mother's face.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why--but--I supposed that you _had_ minded for Eddy and me, mama,\" she\n",

       "\"I have very little money, Imogen.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen hesitated, blushing a little, before saying, \"Surely you were quite\n",
       "rich when papa married you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Hardly rich; but, yes, quite well off.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And you spent it all--on yourself?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie's color, too, had faintly risen. \"Not so much on myself, Imogen,\n",
       "though I wish now that I had been more economical; but I was ignorant\n",
       "of your father's rather reckless expenditure. In the first years of my\n",
       "marriage, before the selfish mother-thing was developed in me, I handed a\n",
       "good deal of my capital over to him, for his work, his various projects; in\n",
       "order to leave him as free for these projects as possible, I educated you\n",
       "and Eddy--that, too, came out of my capital. And the building of the house\n",
       "in Vermont swallowed a good deal of money.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen's blush had deepened. \"Of course,\" she said, \"there is no more\n",
       "reckless expenditure possible--since you use the term, mama--than keeping\n",
       "up two establishments for one family; that, of course, was your own choice.\n",
       "But, putting that aside, you must surely, still, have a good deal left. See\n",
       "how you live; see how you are taken care of, with a maid,--I've never had\n",
       "a maid, papa, as you know, thought them self-indulgences,--see how you\n",
       "dress,\" she cast a glance upon the refinements of her mother's black.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How I dress, my child! May I ask what that dress you have on cost you?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I believe only in getting the best. This, for the best, was inexpensive.\n",
       "One hundred dollars.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Twenty pounds,\" Valerie translated, as if to impress the sum more fully on\n",
       "her mind. \"I know that clothes over here are ruinous. Now mine cost only\n",
       "eight pounds and was made by a very little woman in London.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen cast another glance, now of some helpless wonder, at the dress.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Of course you are so clever about such things; I shouldn't wish to spend\n",
       "my thought--and I couldn't spend my time--on clothes. And then the standard\n",
       "of wages is so scandalously low in Europe; I confess that I would rather\n",
       "not profit by it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am a very economical woman, Imogen,\" said Valerie, with some briskness\n",
       "of utterance. \"My cottage in Surrey costs me fifty pounds a year. I keep\n",
       "two maids, my own maid, a cook, a gardener; there's a pony and trap and a\n",
       "stable-boy. I have friends with me constantly and pay a good many visits.\n",
       "Yet my income is only eight hundred pounds a year.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Eight hundred--four thousand dollars,\" Imogen translated, a note of sharp\n",
       "alarm in her voice. \"That, of course, would not be nearly enough for all of\n",
       "us.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not living as you have, certainly, dear.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But papa? Surely papa has left something! He must have made money at his\n",
       "legal practice.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Never much. His profession was always a by-issue with him. I find that his\n",
       "affairs are a good deal involved; when all the encumbrances are cleared\n",
       "off, we think, Mr. Haliwell and I, that we may secure an amount that will\n",
       "bring our whole income to about five thousand dollars a year. If we go on\n",
       "living in New York it will require the greatest care to be comfortable on\n",
       "that. We must find a flat somewhere, unless you cared to live in England,\n",
       "where we could be very comfortable indeed, without effort, on what we\n",

       "\n",
       "Imogen was keeping a quiet face, but her mother, with a pang of helpless\n",
       "pity and compunction, saw tears near the surface, and that, to control\n",
       "them, she fixed herself on the meaning of the last words. \"Live out of my\n",
       "own country! Never!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, dear, I didn't think that you would want to; I didn't want it for you,\n",
       "either; I only suggested it so that you might see clearly just where we\n",
       "stand, and in case you might prefer it, with our limited means.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen's next words broke out even more vehemently. \"I can't leave this\n",
       "house! I _can't_! It is my home.\" The tears ran down her face.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My poor darling!\" her mother exclaimed. She rose quickly and came round\n",
       "the table to her, putting her arm around her and trying to draw her near.\n",
       "\n",
       "But Imogen, covering her eyes with one hand, held her off. \"It's wrong.\n",
       "It's unfair. I should have been told before.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Imogen, _I_ did not know. I was not admitted to your father's confidence.\n",
       "I used to speak to you sometimes, you must remember, about being careful.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I never thought about it. I thought he made a great deal--I thought you\n",

       "\n",
       "\"It _is_ my fault, in one sense, I know,\" her mother said, still standing\n",
       "beside her, her hand on her shoulder. \"If I had been here I could have\n",
       "prevented some of it. But--it has seemed so inevitable.\" The tears rose in\n",
       "Valerie's eyes also; she looked away to conquer them. \"Don't blame me too\n",
       "much, dear. I shall try to do my best now. And then, after all, it's not of\n",
       "such tragic importance, is it? We can be very happy with what we have.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen wept on: \"Leave my home!\"\n",

       "\"There, there. Don't cry so. We won't leave it. We will manage somehow. We\n",
       "will stay on here, for a time at least--until you marry, Imogen. You will\n",

       "very long.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But the attempt was an unfortunately timed one. \"Oh, mama!\n",

       "\"The economic, materialistic, worldly point of view--that money problems\n",

       "\n",
       "Her mother now guessed that the self-abandonment was over and that, with\n",
       "recovered control, she found it difficult to pick up her usual dignity. The\n",
       "insight added to her tenderness. She touched the girl's hair softly, said,\n",
       "in a soothing voice, that she had meant nothing, nothing gross or\n",
       "unfeeling, and, seeing that her nearness was not, at the moment, welcome,\n",
       "returned to her own place at the other end of the table.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen now dried her eyes. In the consternation that her mother's\n",
       "statements had caused her there had, indeed, almost at once, arisen the\n",
       "consoling figure of Jack Pennington, and she did not know whether she were\n",
       "the more humiliated by her own grief, for such a mercenary cause, or by\n",
       "this stilling of it, this swift realization that the cramped life need\n",
       "last no longer, for herself, than she chose. To feel so keenly the need of\n",
       "escape was to feel herself imprisoned by the new conditions; for never,\n",
       "never for one moment, must the need of escape weigh with her in her\n",
       "decision as to Jack's place in her life. She must accept the burden, not\n",
       "knowing that it would ever be lifted, and with this acceptance the sense of\n",
       "humiliation left her, so that she could more clearly see that she had had a\n",
       "right to her dismay. Her crippled life would hurt not only herself, but all\n",
       "that she meant to others--her beneficence, her radiance, her loving power;\n",
       "so hurt it, that, for one dark moment, had come just a dart of severity\n",
       "toward her father. The memory of her mother's implied criticism had\n",
       "repulsed it; dear, wonderful, transcendentalist, she must be worthy of him\n",
       "and not allow her thoughts, in their coward panic, to sink to the mother's\n",
       "level. This was the deepest call upon her courage that had ever come to\n",
       "her. Calls to courage were the very breath of the spiritual life. Imogen\n",
       "lifted her heart to the realm of spirit, where strength was to be found,\n",
       "and, though her mother, with those implied criticisms, had pierced her, she\n",
       "could now, with her recovered tranquility of soul, be very patient with\n",
       "her. In a voice slightly muffled and uncertain, but very gentle, she said\n",
       "that she thought it best to live on in the dear home. \"We must retrench in\n",
       "other places, mama. I would rather give up almost anything than this. _He_\n",
       "is here to me.\" Her tears rose again, but they were no longer tears of\n",
       "bitterness. \"It would be like leaving him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, dear, yes; that shall be as you wish,\" said Valerie, who was deeply\n",
       "considering what these retrenchments should be. She, too, was knowing a\n",
       "qualm of humiliation over self-revelations. She had not expected that it\n",
       "would be really so painful, in such trivial matters, to adjust herself to\n",
       "the most ordinary maternal sacrifices. It only showed her the more plainly\n",
       "how fatal, how almost fatal, it was to the right impulses, to live away\n",
       "from family ties; so that at their first pressure upon her, in a place that\n",
       "sharply pinched, she found herself rueful.\n",
       "\n",
       "For the first retrenchment, of course, must be the sending back to\n",
       "England of her dear, staunch Felkin, who had taken such care of her for\n",
       "so many years. Her heart was heavy with the thought. She was very fond\n",
       "of Felkin, and to part with her would be, in a chill, almost an ominous\n",
       "way, like parting with the last link that bound her to \"over there.\"\n",
       "Besides,--Valerie was a luxurious woman,--unpleasant visions went through\n",
       "her mind of mud to be brushed off and braid to be put on the bottoms of\n",
       "skirts; stockings to darn-she was sure that it was loathsome to darn\n",
       "stockings; buttons to keep in their places; all the thousand and one little\n",
       "rudiments of life, to which one had never had to give a thought, looming,\n",
       "suddenly, in the foreground of one's consciousness. And how very tiresome\n",
       "to do one's own hair. Well, it couldn't be helped. She accepted the\n",
       "accompanying humiliation, finding no refuge in Imogen's spiritual\n",
       "consolations.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Eddy leaves Harvard this spring and goes into Mr. Haliwell's office. He\n",
       "will live with us here, then. And we can be very economical about food and\n",
       "clothes; I can help little dressmakers with yours, you know,\" she said,\n",
       "smiling at her child.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Everything, mama, everything must be done, rather than leave this house.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We mustn't let the girls' clubs suffer, either,\" Valerie attempted further\n",
       "to lighten the other's gloomy resolution. \"That's one of the first claims.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I must balance all claims, with justice. I have many other calls upon me,\n",
       "dear, and it will need earnest thought to know which to eliminate.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, the ones you care about most are the ones we'll try to fit in.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "Imogen rose, drawing a long, sighing breath. Under her new and heavy\n",
       "burden, her mother, in these suggestions for the disposal of her life,\n",
       "was glib, assured. But the necessity for tenderness and forbearance was\n",
       "strongly with her. She went round the table to Valerie, pressed her head to\n",
       "her breast and kissed her forehead, saying, \"Forgive me if I have seemed\n",
       "hard, darling.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, dear, no; I quite understood all you felt,\" Valerie said, returning\n",
       "the kiss. But, after Imogen had left her, she sat for a long time, very\n",

       "VIII\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack thought that he had never seen Imogen looking graver than on that\n",
       "night when he came again. Her face seemed calm only because she so\n",
       "compressed and controlled all sorts of agitating things. Her mother was\n",
       "with her in the lamp-lit library and he guessed already that, in any case,\n",
       "Imogen, before her mother, would rarely show gaiety and playfulness. Gaiety\n",
       "and playfulness would seem to condone the fact that her mother found so\n",
       "little need of help in \"bearing\" the burden of her regret and of her\n",
       "self-reproach. But, allowing for that fact, Imogen's gravity was more than\n",
       "negative. It confronted him like a solemn finger laid on firmly patient\n",
       "lips; he felt it dwell upon him like solemn eyes while he shook hands with\n",
       "Mrs. Upton, whom he had not seen since the morning of her arrival.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Upton, too, was grave, after a fashion; but her whole demeanor might\n",
       "be decidedly irritating to a consciousness so burdened with a sense of\n",
       "change as Imogen 'a evidently was. Even before that finger, those eyes,\n",
       "into which he had symbolized Imogen's manner, Mrs. Upton's gravity could\n",
       "break into a smile quite undisturbed, apparently, by any inappropriateness.\n",
       "She sat near the lamp crocheting; soft, white wool sliding through her\n",
       "fingers and wave after wave of cloudy substance lengthening a tiny baby's\n",
       "jacket, so very small a jacket that Jack surmised it to be a gift for an\n",
       "expectant mother. He further surmised that Mrs. Upton would be very nice to\n",
       "expectant mothers; that they would like to have her abound.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Upton would not curb her smile on account of Imogen's manner, nor\n",
       "would she recognize it to the extent of tacitly excluding her from the\n",
       "conversation. She seemed, indeed, to pass him on, in all she said, to\n",
       "Imogen, and Jack, once more, found his situation between them a little\n",
       "difficult, for if Mrs. Upton passed him on, Imogen was in no hurry to\n",
       "receive him. He had, once or twice, the sensation of being stranded, and\n",
       "it was always Mrs. Upton who felt his need and who pushed him off into the\n",
       "ease of fresh questions.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was going back to Boston the next day and asked Imogen if he could take\n",
       "any message to Mary Osborne.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Thank you, Jack,\" said Imogen, \"but I write to Mary, always, twice a week.\n",
       "She depends on my letters.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When is she coming to you again?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am afraid she is not to come at all, now.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You're not going away?\" the young man asked sharply, for her voice of sad\n",
       "acceptance implied something quite as sorrowful.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, no!\" Imogen answered, \"but mama does not feel that I can have my\n",
       "friend here now.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack, stranded indeed, looked his discomfort and, glancing at Mrs. Upton,\n",
       "he saw it echoed, though with, a veiled echo. She laid down her work; she\n",
       "looked at her daughter as though to probe the significance of her speech,\n",
       "and, not finding her clue, she sat rather helplessly silent.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well,\" said Jack, with attempted lightness, \"I hope that I'm not exiled,\n",
       "too.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, Jack, how can you!\" said Imogen. \"It is only that we have discovered\n",
       "that we are very, very poor, and one's hospitable impulses are shackled.\n",
       "Mama has been so brave about it, and I don't want to put any burdens upon\n",
       "her, especially burdens that would be so uncongenial to her as dear, funny\n",
       "Mary. Mama could hardly care for that typical New England thing. Don't mind\n",
       "Jack, mama; he is such a near friend that I can talk quite frankly before\n",
       "him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "For Mrs. Upton was now gathering up her innocent work, preparatory, it was\n",
       "evident, to departure.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are not displeased, dear!\" Imogen protested as she rose, not angry,\n",
       "not injured--Jack was trying to make it out--but full of a soft withdrawal.\n",
       "\"Please don't go. I so want you and Jack to see something of each other.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I will come back presently,\" said Mrs. Upton. And so she left them. Jack's\n",
       "thin face had flushed.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She means that _she_ won't talk quite frankly before you, you see,\" said\n",
       "Imogen. \"Don't mind, dear Jack, she is full of these foolish little\n",
       "conventionalities; she cares so tremendously about the forms of things; I\n",
       "simply pay no attention; that's the best way. But it's quite true, Jack; I\n",
       "don't know that I can afford to have my friends come and stay with me any\n",
       "more. Apparently mama and papa, in their so different ways, have been very\n",
       "extravagant; and I, too, Jack, have been extravagant. I never knew that I\n",
       "mustn't be. The money was given to me as I asked for it--and there were\n",
       "so many, so many claims,--oh, I can't say that I'm sorry that it is gone\n",
       "as it went. 'But now that we are very poor, I want it to be my pleasures,\n",
       "rather than hers, that are cut off; she depends so upon her pleasures, her\n",
       "comforts. She depends more upon her maid, for instance, than I do even upon\n",
       "my friends. To go without Mary this winter will be hard, of course, but our\n",
       "love is founded on deeper things than seeing and speaking; and mama would\n",
       "feel it tragic, I'm quite sure, to have to do up her own hair.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Good heaven, my dear Imogen! if you are so poor, surely she can learn to\n",
       "do up her own hair!\" Jack burst out, the more vehemently from the fact\n",
       "that Mrs. Upton's unprotesting, unexplanatory departure had, to his own\n",
       "consciousness, involved him with Imogen in a companionship of crudity\n",
       "and inappropriateness. She would not interfere with their frankness, but\n",
       "she would not be frank with them. She didn't care a penny for what his\n",
       "impression of her might be. Imogen might fit as many responsibilities upon\n",
       "her shoulders as she liked and, with her long training in a school of\n",
       "reticences and composures, she would remain placid and indifferent. So Jack\n",
       "worked it out, and he resented, for Imogen and for himself, such tact and\n",
       "such evasion. He wished that they had been more crude, more inappropriate.\n",
       "Thank heaven for crudeness if morality as opposed to manners made one\n",
       "crude. He entrenched himself in that morality now, open-eyed to its\n",
       "seeming priggishness, to say, \"And it's a bigger question than that of her\n",
       "pleasures and yours, Imogen. It's a question of right and wrong. Mary needs\n",
       "you. Your mother ought not to keep a maid if other people's needs are to be\n",
       "sacrificed to her luxuries.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen was looking thoughtfully into the fire, her calmness now not the\n",
       "result of mastery; her own serene assurance was with her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I've thought of all that, Jack; I've weighed it, and though I feel it, as\n",
       "you do, a question of right and wrong, I don't feel that I can force it\n",
       "upon her. It would be like taking its favorite doll from a child. She is\n",
       "trying, I do believe, to atone; she is trying to do her duty by making, as\n",
       "it were, _une acte de présence_; one wants to be very gentle with her; one\n",
       "doesn't want to make things more difficult than they must already seem.\n",
       "Poor, dear little mama. But as for me, Jack, it's more than pleasures that\n",
       "I have to give up. I have to say no to some of those claims that I've given\n",
       "my life to. It's like cutting into my heart to do it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She turned away her head to hide the quiet tears that rose involuntarily,\n",
       "and by the sight of her noble distress, by the realization, too, of such\n",
       "magnanimity toward the trivial little mother, Jack's inner emotion was\n",
       "pushed, suddenly, past all the bolts and barriers. Turning a little pale,\n",
       "he leaned forward and took her hand, stammering as he said: \"Dear, dearest\n",
       "Imogen, you know--you know what I want to ask--whenever you will let me\n",
       "speak; you know the right I want to claim--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It had come, the moment of avowal; but they had glided so quietly upon it\n",
       "that he felt himself unprepared for his own declaration. It wad Imogen's\n",
       "tranquil acceptance, rather than his own eagerness, that made the situation\n",
       "seem real.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I know, dear Jack, of course I know,\" she said. \"It has been a deep, a\n",
       "peaceful joy for a long time to feel that I was first with you. Let it rest\n",
       "there, for the present, dear Jack.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I've not made anything less joyful or less peaceful for you by speaking?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, no, dear. It's only that I couldn't think of it, for some time yet.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You promise me that, meanwhile, you will think of me, as your friend, just\n",
       "as happily as before?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Just as happily, dear Jack; I could never, as long as you are you and I\n",
       "am I, think of you in any other way.\" And she went on, with her tranquil\n",
       "radiance of aspect, \"I have always meant, you know, to make something of my\n",
       "life before I chose what to do with it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack, too, thought Imogen's life a flower so precious that it must be\n",
       "placed where it could best bloom; but, feeling in her dispassionateness a\n",
       "hurt to his hope that it would best bloom in his care, he asked: \"Mightn't\n",
       "the making something of it come after the choice, dear?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Very clear as to what was her own meaning, Imogen shook her lovely,\n",
       "unconfused head. \"No, only the real need could rightly choose, and one can\n",
       "only know the real need when one has made the real self.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "These were Jack's own views, but, hearing them from her lips, they chilled.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It seems to me that your self, already, is very real,\" he said, smiling\n",
       "a little ruefully. And Imogen now, though firm, was very wonderful, for,\n",
       "leaning to him, she put for a moment her hand on his and said, smiling back\n",
       "with the tranquil tenderness: \"Not yet, not quite yet, Jack; but we trust\n",
       "each other's truth, and we can't but trust,--I do, dear Jack, with all my\n",
       "heart,--that it can never part us.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He kissed her hand at that, and promised to trust and to be patient, and\n",
       "Imogen presently lifted matters back into their accustomed place, saying\n",
       "that he must help her with her project for building a country home for her\n",
       "crippled children. She had laid the papers before him and they were deep in\n",
       "ways and means when a sharp, imperious scratching at the door interrupted\n",
       "them.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen's face, as she raised it, showed a touch of weary impatience.\n",
       "\"Mamma's dog,\" she said. \"He can't find her. Let him scratch. He will go\n",
       "away when no one answers.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, let's satisfy him that she isn't here,\" said Jack, who was full of a\n",
       "mild, though alien, consideration for animals.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Can you feel any fondness for such wisps of sentimentality and greediness\n",
       "as that?\" Imogen asked, as the tiny _griffon_ darted into the room and ran\n",
       "about, sniffing with interrogative anxiety.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not fondness, perhaps, but amused liking.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There, now you see he will whine and bark to be let out again. He is as\n",
       "arrogant and as troublesome as a spoilt child.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I'll hold him until she comes,\" said Jack. \"I say, he is a nice little\n",
       "beast--full of gratitude; see him lick my hand.\" He had picked up the dog\n",
       "and come back to her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I really disapprove of such absurd creatures,\" said Imogen. \"Their very\n",
       "existence seems a wrong to themselves and to the world.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, I don't know.\" Theoretically Jack agreed with her as to the\n",
       "extravagant folly of such morsels of frivolity; but, holding the\n",
       "_griffon_ as he was, meeting its merry, yet melancholy, eyes, evading\n",
       "its affectionate, caressing leaps toward his cheek, he couldn't echo her\n",
       "reasonable rigor. \"They take something the place of flowers in life, I\n",
       "suppose.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What takes the place of flowers?\" Mrs. Upton asked. She had come in while\n",
       "they spoke and her tone of kind, mild inquiry slightly soothed Jack's\n",
       "ruffled sensibilities.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This,\" said he, holding out her possession to her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, Tison! How good of you to take care of him. He was looking for me,\n",
       "poor pet.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Imogen was wondering as to the uses of such creatures and I placed them in\n",
       "the decorative category,\" Jack went on, determined to hold his own firmly\n",
       "against any unjustifiable claims of either Tison or his mistress. He\n",
       "accused himself of a tendency to soften under her glance when it was so\n",
       "kindly and so consciously bent upon him. Her indifference cut him and made\n",
       "him hostile, and both softness and hostility were, as he told himself,\n",
       "symptoms of a silly sensitiveness. The proper attitude was one of firmness\n",
       "and humor.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am afraid that you don't care for dogs,\" Mrs. Upton said. She had gone\n",
       "back to her seat, taking up her work and passing her hand over Tison's\n",
       "silky back as he established himself in her lap.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh yes, I do; I care for flowers, too,\" said Jack, folding his arms and\n",
       "leaning back against the table, while Imogen sat before her papers,\n",
       "observant of the little encounter.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But they are not at all in the same category. And surely,\" Mrs. Upton\n",
       "continued, smiling up at him, \"one doesn't justify one's fondness for a\n",
       "creature by its uses.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I think one really must, you know,\" our ethical young man objected,\n",
       "feeling that he must grasp his latent severity when Mrs. Upton's vague\n",
       "sweetness of regard was affecting him somewhat as her dog's caressing\n",
       "little tongue had done. \"If a fondness is one we have a right to, we\n",
       "can justify it,--and it can only be justified by its utility, actual or\n",
       "potential, to the world we are a part of.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Upton continued to smile as though she did not suspect him of wishing\n",
       "to be taken seriously. \"One doesn't reason like that before one allows\n",
       "oneself to become fond.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"There are lots of things we must reason about to get rid of,\" Jack smiled\n",
       "back.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That sounds very chilly and uncomfortable. Besides, something loving,\n",
       "pretty, responsive--something that one can make very happy--is useful to\n",
       "one.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But only that,\" Imogen now intervened, coming to her friend's assistance\n",
       "with decision. \"It serves only one's own pleasure;--that is its only use.\n",
       "And when I think, mama darling, of all the cold, hungry, unhappy children\n",
       "in this great town to-night,--of all the suffering children, such as those\n",
       "that Jack and I have been trying to help,--I can't but feel that your\n",
       "petted little dog there robs some one.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Upton, looking down at her dog, now asleep in a profound content,\n",
       "continued to stroke him in silence.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack felt that Imogen's tone was perhaps a little too rigorous for the\n",
       "occasion. \"Not that we want you to turn Tison out into the streets,\" he\n",
       "said jocosely.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No; you mustn't ask that of me,\" Valerie answered, her tone less light\n",
       "than before. \"It seems to me that there is a place for dear unreasonable\n",
       "things in the world. All that Tison is made for is to be petted. A child is\n",
       "a different problem.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And a problem that it needs all our time, all our strength, all our love\n",
       "and faith to deal with,\" Imogen returned, with gentle sadness. \"You _are_\n",
       "robbing some one, mama dear.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Apparently we are a naughty couple, you and I, Tison,\" Mrs. Upton said,\n",
       "\"but I am too old and you too eternally young to mend.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She had begun to crochet again; but, though she resumed all her lightness,\n",
       "her mildness, Jack fancied that she was a little angry.\n",
       "\n",
       "When he was gone, Mrs. Upton said, looking up at her daughter: \"Of course\n",
       "you must have Mary Osborne to stay with you, Imogen,\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen had gone to the fire and was gazing into it. She was full of a deep\n",
       "contentment. By her attitude toward Jack this evening, her reception of his\n",
       "avowal, she had completely vindicated herself. Peace of mind was impossible\n",
       "to Imogen unless her conscience were clear of any cloud, and now the\n",
       "morning's humiliating fear was more than atoned for. She was not the woman\n",
       "to clutch at safety when pain threatened; she had spoken to him exactly as\n",
       "she would have spoken yesterday, before knowing that she was poor. And,\n",
       "under this satisfaction, was the serene gladness of knowing him so surely\n",
       "hers.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her face, as she turned it toward her mother, adjusted itself to a task of\n",
       "loving severity. \"I cannot think of having her, mama.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why not? She will add almost nothing to our expenses. I never for a moment\n",
       "dreamed of your not having her. I don't know why you thought it my wish.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen looked steadily at her: \"Not your wish, mama? After what you told me\n",
       "this morning?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I only said that we must be economical and careful.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To have one's friends to stay with one is a luxury, is not to be\n",
       "economical and careful. I don't forget what you said of my expensive mode\n",

       "\"I hardly know how to express it. She is so light, yet so deep; and I can't\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Why not?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why, Jack, you know the way _you_ felt about it, the day you and I and\n",
       "Rose talked it over.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But we hadn't seen her then. What I want to know is just what _you_ feel,\n",
       "now that you have seen her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mary had another conscientious pause. \"How can one approve of her while\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Yes, and do you know, Jack,\" Mary lowered her voice while she glanced up\n",
       "at Mrs. Upton's portrait, \"I can hardly believe that she has suffered,\n",

       "a lack in her. On the other hand, in a warmhearted, pagan sort of way, she\n",
       "is, I'm quite sure, one of the kindest of people. Her maid, when she went\n",
       "back to England the other day, cried dreadfully at leaving her, and Mrs.\n",
       "Upton cried too. I happened to find them together just before Felkin went.\n",

       "hair.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack kept silence, reflecting on the picture that Imogen had drawn for\n",
       "him--the child bereft of its toy. Had it given it up willingly, or had it\n",
       "been forced to relinquish it by the pressure of circumstance? Remembering\n",
       "his own stringent words, he felt a qualm of compunction. Had he armed\n",
       "Imogen for this ruthlessness?\n",
       "\n",
       "The lustrous folds of Mrs. Upton's hair, at lunch, reassured him as to her\n",
       "fitness to do without Felkin in that particular, but his mind still dwelt\n",
       "on the picture of the crying child and he asked Imogen, when he was next\n",
       "alone with her, how the departure of Felkin had been effected.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You couldn't manage to let her keep the toy, then?\"\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh, Felkin! No,\" Imogen's face was a little quizzical, \"it couldn't be\n",
       "managed. I thought it over, what you said about sacrificing other people's\n",
       "needs to her luxuries, and felt that you were right. So I put it to her,\n",
       "very, very gently, of course, very tactfully, so that I believe that she\n",
       "thinks that it was she who initiated the idea. Perhaps she _had_ intended\n",
       "from the first to send her back; it was so obvious that a woman as poor as\n",
       "she is ought not to have a maid. All the same, I felt that she was a little\n",
       "vexed with me, poor dear. But, apart from the economical question, I'm glad\n",
       "I insisted. It's so much better for her not to be so dependent on another\n",
       "woman. It's a little degrading for both of them, I think.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack, who theoretically disapproved of all such undemocratic gauds, was\n",
       "sure that Mrs. Upton was much better off without her maid; yet something of\n",
       "the pathos of that image remained with him--the child deprived of its toy;\n",
       "something, too, of discomfort over that echo of her father that he now and\n",
       "then detected in Imogen's serene sense of rightness.\n",
       "\n",
       "This discomfort, this uneasy sense of echoes, returned more than once\n",
       "in the days that followed. Mrs. Upton seemed, as yet, to have made very\n",
       "little difference in the situation; she had glided into it smoothly,\n",
       "unobtrusively--a silken shadow; when she was among them it was of that she\n",
       "made him think; and in her shadowed quietness, as of a tranquil mist at\n",
       "evening or at dawn, he more and more came to feel a peace and sweetness.\n",
       "But it was always in this sweetness and this peace that the contrasting\n",
       "throb of restlessness stirred.\n",
       "\n",
       "He saw her at the meals he frequently attended, meals where the\n",
       "conversation, for the most part, was carried on by Imogen. Mrs. Wake, also\n",
       "a frequent guest, was a very silent one, and Mary an earnest listener.\n",
       "\n",
       "If Imogen's talk had ceased to be very interesting to Jack, that was only\n",
       "because he knew it so well. He knew it so well that, while she talked,\n",
       "quietly, fluently, dominatingly, he was able to remain the dispassionate\n",
       "observer and to wonder how it impressed her mother. Jack watched Mrs.\n",
       "Upton, while Imogen talked, leaning her head on her hand and raising\n",
       "contemplative eyes to her daughter. Those soft, dark eyes, eyes almost\n",
       "somnolent under their dusky brows and half-drooped lashes,--how different\n",
       "they were from Imogen's, as different as dusk from daylight. And they\n",
       "were not really sad, not really sleepy, eyes; that was the surprise of\n",
       "them when, after the downcast mystery, they raised to one suddenly their\n",
       "penetrating intelligence. The poetry of their aspect was constantly\n",
       "contradicted by the prose of their glance. But she did more than turn her\n",
       "own poetry into prose, so he told himself; she turned other people's into\n",
       "prose, too. Her glance became to him a running translation into sane,\n",
       "almost merry, commonplace, of Imogen's soarings. He knew that she made the\n",
       "translation and he knew that it was a prose one, but its meaning she kept\n",
       "for herself. It was when, now and then, he felt that he had hit upon a\n",
       "word, a phrase, that the discomfort, the bewilderment, came; and he would\n",
       "then turn resolutely to Imogen and grasp firmly his own conception of her\n",
       "essential meaning, a meaning that could bear any amount of renderings.\n",
       "\n",
       "She was so beautiful, sitting there, the girl he loved, her pearly face\n",
       "and throat, her coronet of pale, bright gold, rising from the pathetic\n",
       "blackness, that it might well be that the mother felt only his own joy in\n",
       "her loveliness and could spare no margin of consciousness for critical\n",
       "comment. She was so lovely, so young, so good; so jaded, too, with all\n",
       "the labor, the giving of herself, the long thoughts for others; why\n",
       "shouldn't she be dominant and assured? Why shouldn't she even be didactic\n",
       "and slightly complacent? If there was sometimes a triteness in her\n",
       "pronouncements, a lack of humor, of spontaneity, in her enthusiasms, surely\n",
       "no one who loved her could recognize them with any but the tenderest of\n",
       "smiles. He felt quite sure that Mrs. Upton recognized them with nothing\n",
       "else. He felt quite sure that the \"deepest\" thing in Mrs. Upton was the\n",
       "most intense interest in Imogen; but he felt sure, too, that the thing\n",
       "above it, the thing that gazed so quietly, so dispassionately, was complete\n",
       "indifference as to what Imogen might be saying. Didn't her prose, with its\n",
       "unemphatic evenness, imply that some enthusiasms went quite without saying\n",
       "and that some questions were quite disposed of for talk just because they\n",
       "were so firmly established for action? When he had reached this point\n",
       "of query, Jack felt rising within him that former sense of irritation\n",
       "on Imogen's behalf, and on his own. After all, youthful triteness and\n",
       "enthusiasm were preferable to indifference. In the stress of this\n",
       "irritation he felt, at moments, a shock of keen sympathy for the departed\n",
       "Mr. Upton, who had, no doubt, often felt that disconcerting mingling of\n",
       "interest and indifference weigh upon his dithyrambic ardors. He often felt\n",
       "very sorry for Mr. Upton as he looked at his widow. It was better to feel\n",
       "that than to feel sorry for her while he listened to Imogen. It did not do\n",
       "to realize too keenly, through Imogen's echo, what it must have been to\n",
       "listen to Mr. Upton for a lifetime. When, on rare occasions, he had Mrs.\n",
       "Upton to himself, his impulse always was to \"draw her out,\" to extract from\n",
       "her what were her impressions of things in general and what her attitude\n",
       "toward life. She must really, by this time, have enough accepted him as\n",
       "one of themselves to feel his right to hear all sorts of impressions. He\n",
       "was used to talking things over, talking them, indeed, over and over;\n",
       "turning them, surveying them, making the very most of all their possible\n",
       "significance, with men and women to whom his relationship was half\n",
       "brotherly and wholly comradely, and whom, in the small, fresh, clear world,\n",
       "where he had spent his life, he had known since boyhood. It was a very\n",
       "ethical and intellectual little world, this of Jack's, where impressions\n",
       "passed from each to each, as if by right, where some suspicion was felt for\n",
       "those that could not be shared, and where to keep anything so worth while\n",
       "to oneself was almost to rob a whole circle. Reticence had the distinct\n",
       "flavor of selfishness and uncertainty of mind, the flavor of laxity. If one\n",
       "were earnest and ardent and disciplined one either knew what one thought,\n",

       "skeptical as to her statement that her artistic tastes were a mere medley,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Well, yes,\" he owned, \"in a sense; though not in that in which the word\n",

       "essentially a social, not a selfish attainment; it widens our boundaries of\n",

       "\"Ah, there we come to the philosophy of it,\" said Jack. \"It _is_, of\n",

       "achievement; but then, you see, one finds out that the eternal isn't cut up\n",
       "into sections, as it were--art here, ethics there--intellect yonder; one\n",

       "slight bewilderment came in, to feel that he had been upholding some\n",
       "unmoral doctrine she would have smiled in just the same way; and the\n",

       "the type of existence so described, was relieved, and at the same time\n",
       "perturbed, to observe that the humorous kindliness of her manner remained\n",
       "unclouded. No doubt she found the subject too trivial and too remote for\n",
       "gravity. Jack himself had a general idea that serious friendships between\n",

       "other hand, Mrs. Upton had said \"friend\" with decision, and though the\n",
       "word, for her, could not mean what it meant to people like himself and\n",
       "Imogen--a grave, a beautiful bond of mutual help, mutual endeavor, mutual\n",
       "rejoicing in the wonder and splendor of life--even a trivial relationship\n",

       "disapprobation that he heard Imogen go on to say, \"I should like to meet a\n",

       "greatest admiration for her; but, beneath these appreciations, a complete\n",
       "indifference as to Mrs. Wake's opinions and personality showed always in\n",

       "\n",
       "Imogen still gazed from the window. \"Jack, I don't believe that mama is at\n",
       "all the woman to have friends, as we understand the word. I don't believe\n",
       "that it is simply a friendship. Yes, you may well look surprised,\"--she\n",
       "had turned to him now--\"I've never told you. It seemed unfair to her. But\n",
       "again and again I've caught her whispers, hints, about the sentimental\n",
       "attachments mama inspires. You may imagine how I've felt, living here with\n",
       "_him_, in his loneliness. I don't say, I don't believe, that mama was ever\n",
       "a flirt; she is too dignified, too distinguished a woman for that; but the\n",
       "fact remains that whispers of this sort do attach themselves to her name,\n",
       "and a woman is always to blame, in some sense, for that.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack, looking as startled as she had hoped he would, gazed now with\n",
       "frowning intentness on the ground and made no reply.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"As for this Sir Basil,\" Imogen went on, \"I used to wonder if he were\n",
       "another of these triflers with the sanctity of love, and of late I've\n",
       "wondered more. He writes to her constantly. What can the bond between mama\n",
       "and a man of that type be unless it's a sentimental one? And didn't you see\n",
       "her blush to-day?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack now raised his eyes to her and she saw that he, at all events, was\n",
       "blushing. \"I can't bear to hear you talk like this, Imogen,\" he said.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen's own cheeks flamed at the implied reproach. \"Do you mean that I\n",
       "must lock everything, everything I have to suffer, into my own heart? I\n",
       "thought that to you, Jack, I could say anything.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Of course, of course, dear. Only don't _think_ in this way.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I accuse her of nothing but accepting this sort of homage.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I know; of course,--only not even to me. They are friends. We have no\n",
       "right to spy upon them; it's almost as if you had laid a trap for her and\n",
       "then pointed her out to me in it. Oh, I know that you didn't mean it so.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Spy on her! I only wanted to know!\"\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Can you feel that a friendship to be taken seriously? The very kindest\n",
       "thing is to treat it lightly, humorously, as I did. She ought to be laughed\n",
       "out of tolerating such an unbecoming relationship. A woman of her age ought\n",
       "not to be able to blush like that.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Looking down again, still with his deep flush, Jack said, \"Really, Imogen,\n",

       "\"It will be the last touch to all I have to bear, Jack, if mama brings\n",
       "a misunderstanding between you and me. If you can feel it fitting,\n",
       "appropriate, that a widow of barely four months should encourage the\n",
       "infatuation of a stupid old Englishman, then I have no more to say. We\n",

       "she had gone to recently; but, turned from him again and looking out into\n",
       "the evening, her answers were so vague and chill, that presently, casting a\n",
       "glance half mournful and half alarmed upon her, he bade her good-by and\n",
       "left her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen stood looking out unseeingly, a sense of indignation and of fear\n",

       "not yield to the impulse to call out to him, run after him, beg him not to\n",
       "go with a misunderstanding unresolved between them, for she was right and\n",
       "he was wrong. She had told him to wait and see if it wasn't the case, what\n",
       "she had said; and now they must wait. She believed that it was the case,\n",
       "and the thought filled her with a sense of personal humiliation.\n",
       "\n",
       "Since her summing up of the situation in the library, not three months ago,\n",
       "that first quiet sense of mastery had been much shaken, and now for weeks\n",
       "there had been with her constantly a strange gliding of new realizations.\n",
       "This one seemed the last touch to her mother's wrongness--a wrongness that\n",
       "had threatened nothing, had crushed down on nothing, and that yet pervaded\n",
       "more and more the whole of life--that she should bring back to her old\n",
       "deserted home not a touch of penitence and the incense of absurd devotions.\n",
       "Friends of that sort, middle-aged, dull Englishmen, didn't, Imogen had\n",
       "wisely surmised, write to one every week. It wasn't as if they had uniting\n",
       "interests to bind them. Even a literary, a political, a philanthropic,\n",
       "correspondence Imogen would have felt as something of an affront to her\n",
       "father's memory, now, at this time; such links with the life that had\n",
       "always been a sore upon their family dignity should have been laid aside\n",
       "while the official mourning lasted, so to speak. But Sir Basil, she felt\n",
       "sure, had no mitigating interests to write about, and the large, square\n",
       "envelope that lay so often on the hall-table seemed to her like a pert,\n",
       "placid face gazing in at the house of mourning. To-day, yes, she had wanted\n",
       "to know, to see, and suspicions and resentments from dim had become keen.\n",
       "\n",
       "And now, to complete it all, Jack did not understand. Jack thought her\n",
       "unfair, unkind. He had left her with that unresolved discord between them.\n",
       "A sense of bereavement, foreboding, and desolation filled her heart. On the\n",
       "table beside her stood a tall vase of lilies that he had sent her, and as\n",
       "she stood, thinking sad and bitter thoughts, she passed her hand over them\n",
       "from time to time, bending her face to them, till, suddenly, the tears rose\n",
       "and fell and, closing her eyes, holding the flowers against her cheek, she\n",
       "began to cry.\n",
       "\n",
       "That was what she had meant to be like, the pure, sweet aroma of these\n",
       "flowers, filling all the lives about her with a spiritual fragrance. She\n",
       "did so want to be good and lovely, to make goodness and loveliness grow\n",
       "about her. It was hard, hard, when that was what she wanted--all that she\n",
       "wanted--to receive these buffets from loved hands, to see loved eyes look\n",
       "at her with trouble and severity. It was nothing, indeed,--it was, indeed,\n",
       "only to be expected,--that her mother should not recognize the spiritual\n",
       "fragrance; that Jack should be so insensible to it pierced her. And feeling\n",
       "herself alone in a blind and hostile world, she sobbed and sobbed, finding\n",
       "a sad relief in tears. She was able to think, while she wept, that though\n",
       "it was a relief she mustn't let it become a weakness; mustn't let herself\n",
       "slide into the danger of allowing grief and desolation to blur outlines for\n",
       "her. That others were blind mustn't blind her; that others did not see her\n",
       "as good and lovely must not make her, with cowardly complaisance, forswear\n",
       "her own clear consciousness of right. She was thinking this, and her sobs\n",
       "were becoming a little quieter, when her mother, now in her evening\n",
       "tea-gown, came back into the room.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen was not displeased that her grief should have this particular\n",
       "witness. Besides all the deep, unspoken wrongs, her mother must be\n",
       "conscious of smaller wrongs against her this afternoon, must know that she\n",
       "had--well--tried to put her, as it were, in her place, first about the\n",
       "letter and then about Mrs. Wake's lack of aristocratic instinct. She must\n",
       "know this and must know that Imogen knew it. These were trivial matters,\n",
       "not to be recognized between them; and how completely indifferent they\n",
       "were to her her present grief would demonstrate. Such tears fell only for\n",
       "great sorrows. Holding the flowers to her cheek, she wept on, turning her\n",
       "face away. She knew that her mother had paused, startled, at a loss; and,\n",
       "gravely, without one word, she intended, in a moment, unless her mother\n",
       "should think it becoming to withdraw, to leave the room, still weeping. But\n",
       "she had not time to carry this resolution into effect. Suddenly, and much\n",
       "to her dismay, she felt her mother's arms around her, while her mother's\n",
       "voice, alarmed, tender, tearful, came to her: \"Poor darling, my poor\n",
       "darling, what is it? Please tell me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Physical demonstrations were never pleasing to Imogen, who, indeed,\n",
       "disliked being touched; and now, though she submitted to having her head\n",
       "drawn down to her mother's shoulder, she could not feel that the physical\n",
       "contact in any way bridged the chasm between them. She felt, presently,\n",
       "from her mother's inarticulate murmurs of compunction and pity, that this\n",
       "was, apparently, what she had hoped for. It was evidently with difficulty,\n",
       "before her child's unresponsive silence, that she found words.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Is it anything that I've done?\" she questioned. \"Have I seemed cross this\n",
       "afternoon? I _was_ a little cross, I know. Do forgive me, dear.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Enveloped as she was in her mother's arms, so near that she could feel the\n",
       "warmth and smoothness of her shoulder through the fine texture of her gown,\n",
       "so near that a fresh fragrance, like that from a bank of violets, seemed\n",
       "to breathe upon her, Imogen found it a little difficult to control the\n",
       "discomfort that the contact aroused in her. \"Of course I forgive you, dear\n",
       "mama,\" she said, in a voice that had regained its composure. \"But, oh\n",
       "no!--it was not at all for that--I hardly noticed it. It's nothing that you\n",
       "can help, dear.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But I can't bear to have you cry and not know what's the matter.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Your knowing wouldn't help me, would it?\" said Imogen, with a faint smile,\n",
       "lifting her hand to press her handkerchief to her eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, of course not; but it would help _me_--for my sake, then.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Then, if it helps you, it was papa I was thinking of. I miss him so.\" And\n",
       "with the words, that placed before her suddenly a picture of her own\n",
       "desolation, a great sob again shook her. \"I'm so lonely now, so lonely.\"\n",
       "Her mother held her, not speaking, though Imogen now felt that she, too,\n",
       "wept, and a greater bitterness rose in her at the thought that it was not\n",
       "for her dead father that the tears fell but in pure weak sympathy and\n",
       "helplessness. She, herself, was the only lonely one. She alone, remembered.\n",
       "She alone longed for him. In this sharpened realization of her own sorrow\n",
       "she forgot that it had not been the actual cause of her grief.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Poor darling; poor child,\" her mother said at last. \"Imogen, I know that\n",
       "I've failed, in so much. But I want so to make up for things, if I can; to\n",

       "\n",

       "it's mine; it must be the mother's fault if she can't make herself needed.\n",
       "Only you can't know how it all began, from so far back--that sense that you\n",
       "didn't need me. But I shirked; I know that I shirked. Things seemed too\n",
       "hard for me--I didn't know how to bear them. Perhaps you might have come\n",

       "incongruous with its own benignant loftiness, had yet been able, while she\n",
       "spoke, to gather her thoughts into a keen, moral concentration upon her\n",
       "actual words. She was accustomed, in moments of moral stress, to a quick\n",
       "lifting of her heart and mind for help and insight toward the highest that\n",
       "she knew, and she felt herself pray now, \"Help me to be true, to her, for\n",
       "her.\" The prayer seemed to raise her from some threatened abasement, and\n",
       "from her regained height she spoke with a sense of assured revelation.\n",
       "\"We can't have things by merely _wanting_, them. To gain anything we must\n",

       "as they talked, while the dear old aunt sat near, turning the leaves of a\n",
       "book, joining in with a word now and then, it was, in the main, the soft,\n",
       "sweet sense of ease, like the breath of violets in the air, that surrounded\n",

       "formal rows, arrange them in pretty, intricate posies, or, suddenly, gather\n",
       "them into generous handfuls which she gave you with a pleased glance and\n",
       "laugh. It was queer to find a person who took all \"talk\" so lightly and who\n",
       "yet, he felt quite sure, took some things hard. It was like the contrast\n",
       "between her indolent face and her clear, unbiased gaze, that would not\n",
       "flinch or deceive itself from or about anything that it met. Apparently\n",
       "most of the things that it met she didn't take solemnly. The world, as far\n",

       "look so young when, measured beside his own contrasted youth, he felt how\n",
       "old she was. It was pathetic that eyes so clear should fade, that a cheek\n",
       "so rounded should wither, that the bloom and softness and freshness that\n",
       "her whole being expressed should be evanescent. Jack was not given to such\n",

       "eddy of escaping tendrils,--these things pervaded his consciousness. He\n",
       "didn't like to think of her being hurt and unhappy, and he often wondered\n",
       "if she wasn't bound to be both. He wondered about her a great deal. He\n",
       "received, on every day they met, hints and illuminations, but never the\n",
       "clear revealment that he hoped for. The thing that grew surer and surer\n",
       "for him was her essential liking, and the thing that became sweeter and\n",
       "sweeter, though the old perplexity mingled with it, was the superficial\n",
       "amusement he caused her. One of the things that, he began to see, amused\n",
       "her a little was the catholicity of taste displayed in the books scattered\n",
       "about his rooms, the volumes of French and Italian that the great-aunt\n",
       "would take up while they talked. They were books that she felt, he was\n",
       "quite sure, as funnily incongruous with his whole significance, and that\n",
       "their presence there meant none of the things that in another environment\n",
       "they would have stood for; neither cosmopolitanism nor an unbiased\n",
       "connoisseurship interested in all the flowers--_du mal_ among the rest--of\n",
       "the human intelligence. That they meant for him his own omniscient\n",
       "appreciation, unshakenly sure of the ethical category into which he could\n",
       "place each fruit, however ominous its tainted ripeness; each flower,\n",
       "however freaked with perverse tints, left her mildly skeptical; so\n",
       "that he felt, with just a flicker of his old irritation, that the very\n",
       "plentifulness of esthetic corruption that he could display to her testified\n",
       "for her to his essential guilelessness, and, perhaps, to a blandness and\n",
       "narrowness of nature that lacked even the capacity for infection. Jack had\n",
       "to own to himself that, though he strove to make it rigorously esthetic,\n",
       "his seeing of d'Annunzio--to take at random one of the _fleurs du mal_--was\n",
       "as a shining, a luridly splendid warning of what happened to decadent\n",
       "people in unpleasant Latin countries. Such lurid splendor was as far from\n",
       "him as the horrors of the Orestean Trilogy. In Mrs. Upton's eyes this\n",
       "distance, though a distinct advantage for him, was the result of no choice\n",
       "or conflict, but of environment merely, and she probably thought that the\n",
       "problems of Nietzschean ethics were not to be solved and disposed of by\n",
       "people whom they could never touch. But all the same, and it was here that\n",
       "the atoning softness came in, he felt that she liked him the better for\n",

       "product under a glass case. And if he amused her it was not because of\n",
       "any sense of superior wisdom; she didn't deny her consciousness of wider\n",
       "contrasts, but she made no claim at all for deeper insight;--the very way\n",
       "in which she talked over the sinister people with him showed that,--asking\n",
       "him his opinion about this or that and opening a volume here and there to\n",
       "read out in her exquisite French or Italian some passage whose full beauty\n",
       "he had never before so realized. Any criticism or comment that she offered\n",
       "was, evidently, of the slightest weight in her own estimation; but, there\n",
       "again one must remember, so many things seemed light to Mrs. Upton, so\n",

       "burned steadily. From her growing fondness for him he could gage how fond\n",

       "too, kept back hers, that she talked from his supposed point of view, as\n",

       "in it that an artist feels in his work, or that Rose feels in dancing\n",
       "better and looking prettier than any girl in a ball-room,--that any one\n",

       "vexation was the relief of feeling himself at one with her, altogether\n",
       "at one, in opposition to this implied criticism of Imogen. Together they\n",
       "shared the conviction--was it the only one they shared about Imogen?--that\n",

       "many things that lay beneath it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her mother had felt that the tears on that occasion were in part a result\n",

       "\"She wanted to blur my reason with instinct; to mesh me in the blind filial\n",

       "that her reason had dominated the scene as a lighthouse beacon shines\n",
       "steadily over tossing and ambiguous waters. Satisfaction was in the vision;\n",
       "the deep content of having, as she would have expressed it, \"been true to\n",

       "\n",

       "growing vaguely in him--so vaguely that it was like nothing with a definite\n",
       "edge or shape, resembling, rather, a shadow of the encompassing gloom, a\n",
       "shadow that only her own far-reaching beams revealed. As the light hovers\n",
       "on the confines of the dark she had felt--a silence.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was silent--he watched. That was the summing up of the change. He really\n",

       "or was coming to, better than he had ever done before, better than she\n",
       "understood herself. And with the new understanding it was exactly as if he\n",
       "had found that his focus was misdirected. He no longer looked up; Imogen\n",
       "knew that by the fact that when, metaphorically, her eyes were cast down\n",
       "to meet with approbation and sweet encouragement his upturned admiration,\n",
       "vacancy, only, met their gaze. He no longer--so her beam pierced further\n",
       "and further--looked at her on a level, with the frankness of mere mutual\n",
       "need and trust. No; such silence, such watchfulness implied superiority.\n",
       "The last verge of shadow was reached when she could make out that he\n",
       "looked at her from an affectionate, a paternal,--oh, yes, still a very\n",
       "lover-like,--height, not less watchful for being tender; not less steady\n",
       "for being, still, rather puzzled. Beyond that she couldn't pierce. It was\n",
       "indeed a limit denoting a silent revolution in their relationship. When she\n",
       "came to the realization, Imogen, starting back, indignant through all her\n",
       "being, promised herself that if he looked down she, at all events, would\n",
       "never lend herself to the preposterous topsy-turvydom by looking up. She\n",
       "would firmly ignore that shift of focus. She would look straight before\n",
       "her; she would look, as she spoke, the truth. She \"followed her gleam.\" She\n",
       "stood beside her beacon. And she told herself that her truth, her holding\n",
       "to it, might cost her a great deal.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was not that she feared to lose him,--if she chose to keep him; but it\n",

       "it was still an almost unimaginable \"if,\" he could not, would not come once\n",
       "more to see clearly, then, as lover, he must be put aside, and even as\n",

       "old attitude.\n",
       "\n",

       "Sir Basil's letter; Felkin's departure; all the blurred medley of the\n",
       "times when she had talked to Jack and Mary and her mother had listened. A\n",
       "dimness, a haze, was over all, and she only escaped it, broke through it,\n",
       "when, fighting her way out to her own secure air and sunlight, she told\n",
       "herself,--as, at all events, the nearest truth to hand,--that it was about\n",
       "Jack, over him, that the web had been spun: the web of a smile that claimed\n",

       "judged nothing, yet softly blighted, through its own indifference, all\n",
       "other people's enthusiasms. And again and again, during these days of\n",
       "adjustment to the clear and the confused vision, Imogen felt the salt hot\n",
       "tears burning in her throat and eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "When Jack and her mother were both back again and he and she united in the\n",
       "mechanical interests of the tableaux, now imminent, the strangest\n",
       "loneliness lay in the fact that she could no longer share her grief, her\n",
       "fear, her anger, with Jack, He was there, near her; but he was, far, far\n",
       "away; and she must control any impulse that would draw him near.\n",
       "\n",
       "She put him to the test; she measured his worth by his power of\n",

       "allurements and her own high demand. But while with her mind and soul, as\n",
       "she told herself, she thus held him away, she was conscious of the inner\n",
       "wail of loneliness and unconscious that, under the steady resolution, every\n",
       "faculty, every charm she possessed, was spinning and stretching itself out\n",
       "to surround and hold him.\n",
       "\n",
       "She made no appeal, but he would feel her quiet sadness weigh upon him;\n",

       "her weariness, of love for her devotedness, when her pale profile bent by\n",
       "lamplight over all the tedious work of the tableaux; knew that her patient\n",
       "\"Good-night, dear Jack,--I'm too tired to stay and talk,\" must smite him\n",
       "with compunction and uneasiness.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was no direct communication; she used symbols to convey to him the\n",
       "significance that he seemed to be forgetting. She took him to one of Miss\n",
       "Bocock's lectures, gently disowning praise for her part in their success.\n",
       "She took him to the hospital for cripple children, where the nurses smiled\n",
       "at her and the children clambered, crutches and all, into her lap,--she\n",
       "knew how lovely she must look, enfolding cripple children. She took both\n",
       "her mother and him to her Girls' Club on the East side, where they saw her\n",
       "surrounded by adoring gratitude and enthusiasm, where she sat hand in hand\n",
       "with her \"girls,\" all sympathy, all tenderness, all interest,--all the\n",
       "things that Jack had loved her for and that he still, of course, loved her\n",

       "Mr. Pennington,\"--so she would lead him up to one of the girls, bold\n",
       "and gay of eye, highly decorated of person. She knew that she left her\n",
       "reputation in safe hands with Evangeline. \"Are you a friend of Miss\n",

       "acquiescence might show in its true light to him, even if her mother's\n",
       "sentimental selfishness didn't. And later, when he very prettily insisted\n",
       "on himself entertaining the club-girls at the Philharmonic, she felt that,\n",
       "after all, no one but her mother had lost in the encounter. The girls were\n",
       "to have their concert (though they might have had many such, had not her\n",

       "lower his own ideal. All the more reason, then, for her to hold fast to her\n",

       "priggish,--well, that _did_ place him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, yes, it does, often,\" he rejoined; but now he smiled at her as though\n",

       "\n",
       "\"If one looks at it as a whole it's as inharmonious as a high, huge stage\n",

       "of the miserable mood that had held her during all the afternoon.\n",
       "\n",
       "His comradely tone brought her the sensation of their old, their so recent,\n",

       "appearance. She saw herself, suddenly, in all the appealing youth and\n",
       "beauty of the Grecian heroine, stamping on his heart, by means of the outer\n",
       "manifestation, that inner reality to which he had become so strangely\n",
       "blind. It was to this revelation of reality that her thought clung, and an\n",
       "added impulse of mere tenderness had helped to bring the words to her lips.\n",
       "In her essential childishness where emotion and the drama of the senses\n",
       "were concerned, she could not have guessed that the impulse, with its\n",
       "tender mask, was the primitive one of conquest, the cruel female instinct\n",
       "for holding even where one might not care to keep. At the bottom of her\n",
       "heart, a realm never visited by her unspotted thoughts, was a yearning,\n",
       "strangely mingled, to be adored, and to wreak vengeance for the faltering\n",

       "the vision that he had relinquished reluctantly, she saw, in another\n",
       "moment, that he hesitated.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"What reason? You mustn't do it just to please me, you know; though it's\n",
       "sweet of you, if that is the reason. Your mother, you see, agreed with you.\n",
       "I hadn't realized that she would mind. You know what she said, just now.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "to control the pain, the anger, that his hesitation gave her, the quick\n",
       "humiliation, too, and she went on with only a deepening of voice:\n",
       "\n",

       "that clearly now, to withhold what I can do for our cause from any selfish\n",
       "shrinking. I felt, in that moment when she and Mrs. Langley debated on the\n",
       "conventional aspect of the matter, that I would be glad, yes, glad, to give\n",
       "myself, since my refusal is seen in the same category as any paltry, social\n",
       "scruple. It was as if a deep and sacred thing of one's heart were suddenly\n",

       "in no way keep it so safe, as by making it this offering of myself. It is\n",

       "\n",

       "that we may, as you feel, overlook when we see the larger fitness. But\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Well, it's as if you had formed the image into which I'm to blow the\n",
       "breath of life. I'm really uncertain, yet, as to the best attitude.\" Imogen\n",
       "was listening to this with some gravity of gaze. \"Do take that last\n",
       "position we decided upon, Imogen. And do you, Mary, take the place of the\n",
       "faltering old Oedipus for a moment. Look down, Imogen; yes, a strong,\n",
       "brooding tenderness of look.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, she gets it wonderfully,\" said Valerie, still at her hem.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not quite deep or still enough,\" Jack objected. \"Stand back, Mary, please,\n",
       "while we work at the expression. No, that's not it yet.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But it's lovely, so. You would have found fault with Antigone herself,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Jack is quite right, mama, pray don't laugh at his suggestions. I\n",

       "mirror with a grave effort to assume the expression demanded of her. \"Is\n",
       "this better, Jack?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes--no;--no, you can't get at all what I mean,\" the young man returned,\n",
       "so almost pettishly that Valerie glanced up at him with a quick flush.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen's resentment, if she felt any, did not become apparent. She accepted\n",
       "condemnation with dignified patience.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I'm afraid that is the best I can do now, though I'll try. Perhaps on the\n",
       "day of the actual performance it will come more deeply to me. There, mama\n",
       "darling, that will do; it's quite right now. I can't put myself into\n",
       "it while you sew down there. I can hardly think that I'm brooding over\n",
       "my tragic father while I see your pins and needles. Now, Jack, is this\n",
       "better?\" With perfect composure she once more took the suggested attitude\n",
       "and expression.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Upton, her dusky flush deepened, rose, stumbling a little from her\n",
       "long stooping, and, steadying herself with her hand on a table, looked at\n",
       "the new effort.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No,--it's worse. It's complacent--self-conscious,\" burst from Jack. \"You\n",
       "look as if you were thinking far more about your own brooding than about\n",
       "your father. Antigone is self-forgetting; absolutely self-forgetting.\" So\n",
       "his rising irritation found impulsive, helpless expression. In the slight\n",
       "silence that followed his words he was aware of the discord that he had\n",
       "crashed into an apparent harmony. He glanced almost furtively at Mrs.\n",
       "Upton. Had she seen--did she guess--the anger, for her, that had broken\n",
       "into these peevish words? She met his eyes with her penetrating depth of\n",
       "gaze, and Imogen, turning to them, saw the interchange; saw Jack abashed\n",
       "and humble, not before her own forbearance but before her mother's wonder\n",
       "and severity.\n",
       "\n",
       "Resentment had been in her, keen and sharp, from his first criticism; nay,\n",
       "from his first ignoring of her claim to praise. It rose now to a flood of\n",
       "righteous indignation. Sweeping round upon them in her white draperies,\n",
       "casting aside--as in a flash she saw it--petty subterfuge and petty fear,\n",
       "coldly, firmly, she questioned him:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I must ask you whether this is mere ill-temper, Jack, or whether you\n",

       "\n",
       "Speechless, confused, Jack gazed at her.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"If you would rather that some one else did the Antigone, pray say so\n",
       "frankly. It will be a relief to me to give up my part. I am very tired.\n",
       "I have a great deal to do. You know why I took up the added burden. My\n",
       "motives make me quite indifferent to petty, personal considerations.\n",
       "All that, from the first, I have had in mind, was to help, to the best\n",
       "of my poor ability. Whom would you rather have? Rose?--Mary?--Clara\n",
       "Bartlett?--Why not mama? I will gladly help any one of them with all that I\n",

       "Jack felt his head rise at last from the submerging flood.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But, Imogen, indeed,--I do beg your pardon. It was odious of me to speak\n",
       "so. No one can do the part but you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why say that, Jack, when you have just told me that I do it worse and\n",
       "worse?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It was only a momentary impression. Really, I'm ashamed of myself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But it's your impression that is the standard in those tableaux. How can I\n",
       "do the part if I contradict your conception?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You can't. I was in a bad temper.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And why, may I ask, were you in a bad temper?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The gaze from her serene yet awful brows was bent upon him, but under it,\n",
       "in a sudden reaction from its very serenity, its very awfulness, a firm\n",
       "determination rose in him to meet it. Turning very red but eyeing Imogen\n",
       "very straight: \"I thought you inconsiderate, ungrateful, to your mother, as\n",
       "you often are,\" he said.\n",
       "\n",

       "with dismay, her hastily adjusted eye-glasses in odd contrast to her\n",
       "classic draperies--and then turning her eyes upon her mother who, still\n",
       "standing near the table, was frowning and looking down.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, mama dear,\" she asked, \"what have you to say to this piece of\n",

       "ungrateful? Do you share Jack's sense of injury?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Upton looked up as though from painful and puzzling reflection.\n",
       "\"My dear Imogen,\" she said, \"I think that you and Jack are rather\n",
       "self-righteous young people, far too prone to discussing yourselves. I\n",
       "think that you were a little inconsiderate; but Jack has no call to take up\n",
       "my defense or to express any opinion as to our relations. Of course you\n",
       "will do the Antigone, and of course, when he recovers his temper,--and I\n",
       "believe he has already,--he will be very glad that you should. And now\n",
       "let's have no more of this foolish affair.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "None of them had ever heard her make such a measured, and, as it were,\n",
       "such a considered speech before, and the unexpectedness of it so wrought\n",
       "upon them that it reduced not only Jack but even the voluble Antigone to\n",
       "silence. But in Jack's silence was an odd satisfaction, even an elation.\n",
       "He didn't mind his own humiliation--that of an officious little boy put in\n",
       "a corner--one bit; for there in the corner opposite was Imogen, actually\n",
       "Imogen, and the sight of it gave him a shameful pleasure.\n",
       "\n",
       "Meanwhile Mrs. Upton calmly resumed her work at the hem, finished it,\n",
       "turned her daughter about and pronounced it all quite right.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Now get into warmer clothes and come down to tea, which will be here\n",

       "Imogen, by now, was recovered from the torpor of her astonishment.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mary, will you come with me, I'll want your help.\" And then, as Mary, whom\n",
       "alone she could count as an ally, joined her, she paused before departure,\n",
       "gathering her chlamys about her. \"If I am silent, mama, pray don't imagine\n",
       "that it is you who have silenced me,\" she said. \"I certainly could not\n",
       "think of defending myself to you. My character, with all its many faults,\n",
       "speaks for itself with those who understand me and what I aim at. All I ask\n",
       "of you, mama, is not to imagine, for a moment, that you are one of those.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "So Antigone, white, smiling, wrathful, swept away, Mary behind her,\n",
       "round-eyed and aghast, and Valerie was left confronting the overwhelmed\n",
       "Jack.\n",
       "\n",
       "He could find not one word to say, and for some moments Valerie, too, stood\n",
       "silent, slipping her needle back and forth in her fingers and looking hard\n",
       "at the carpet.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It's all my fault!\" Jack burst out suddenly. \"Blundering, silly fool that\n",
       "I am! Do say that you forgive me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She did not look at him, but, still slipping her needle with the minute,\n",
       "monotonous gesture back and forth, she nodded.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But say it,\" Jack protested. \"Scold me as much as you please. It's all\n",
       "true; I'm a prig, I know. But say that you forgive me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "A smile quivered on her cheek, and putting out her hand she answered:\n",
       "\"There's nothing to forgive, Jack. I lost my temper, too. And it's all mere\n",
       "nonsense.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He seized her hand, and then, only then, realized from something in the\n",
       "quiver of the smile, something muffled in the lightness of her voice, that\n",
       "she was crying.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh!\" broke from him; \"oh! what brutes we are!\"\n",
       "\n",

       "swiftly put her handkerchief to her eyes, and after the passage of the\n",
       "scudding rain-cloud she confronted him clearly once more.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why, it's all my fault,--don't you know,--from the beginning,\" she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "He understood her perfectly. She had never been so near him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You _know_ that's not true,\" he said. And then, at last, his eyes, widely\n",
       "upon her, told her on which side his sympathies were enlisted in the\n",
       "long-drawn contest between,--not between poor Imogen and herself, that was\n",
       "a mere result--but between herself and her husband.\n",
       "\n",
       "And that she understood his understanding became at once apparent to him.\n",
       "He had never seen her blush as she blushed then, and when the deep glow had\n",
       "passed she became very white and looked very weary, almost old.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, I don't know it, Jack,\" she said. \"And you, certainly, do not. And\n",
       "now, dear Jack, don't let us speak of this any more. Will you help me to\n",
       "clear this table for the tea-things.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "So this, for Imogen, was the result of her loving impulse during the frosty\n",
       "walk down Fifth Avenue. All her sweet, wordless appeals had been in vain.\n",
       "Jack had admired her as he might have admired a marionette; her beauty had\n",
       "meant less to him than her mother's dressmaking; and as she sat alone in\n",
       "her room on that afternoon, having gently and firmly sent Mary down to tea\n",
       "with the ominous message that she cared for none, she saw that the shadow\n",
       "between her and Jack loomed close upon them now, the shadow that would blot\n",
       "out all their future, as a future together. And Imogen was frightened,\n",
       "badly frightened, at the prospect of that empty future.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her fragrant branch of life that had bloomed so fully and freshly in her\n",
       "hand, a scepter and a fairy wand of beneficence, had withered to a thorny\n",
       "scourge for her own shoulders. She looked about her, before her. She\n",
       "realized with a new, a cutting keenness, that Jack was very rich and she\n",
       "very poor. The chill of poverty had hardly reached her as yet, the warm\n",
       "certainty of its cessation had wrapped her round too closely; but it\n",
       "reached her now, and the thought of that poverty, unrelieved, perhaps, for\n",
       "all her life, the thought of the comparative obscurity to which it would\n",
       "consign her, filled her with a real panic; and, as before, the worst part\n",
       "of the panic was that she should feel it, she, the scorner of material\n",
       "things. Suppose, just suppose, that no one else came. Everything grew gray\n",
       "at the thought. Charities, friends, admiration, these were poor substitutes\n",
       "for the happy power and pride that as a rich man's adored wife would have\n",
       "been hers. And the fact that had transformed her blossoming branch into the\n",
       "thorny scourge was that Jack's adored wife she would never be. His humbled,\n",
       "his submissive, his chastened and penitent wife,--yes, on those terms; yes,\n",
       "she could see it, the future, like a sunny garden which one could only\n",
       "reach by squeezing oneself through some painfully narrow aperture. The\n",
       "fountains, the flowers, the lawns were still hers--if she would stoop and\n",
       "crawl; and for Imogen the mere imagining of herself in such a posture\n",
       "brought a hot blush to her forehead. Not only would she have scorned such\n",
       "means of reaching the life of ample ease and rich benevolence, but they\n",
       "were impossible to her nature. A garden that one must crouch to enter was\n",
       "a prison. Better, far better, her barren, dusty, lonely life than such\n",
       "humiliation; such apostasy.\n",
       "\n",
       "She faced it all often, the future, the panic, during the last days of\n",
       "preparation for the tableaux, days during which, with a still magnanimity,\n",
       "she fulfilled the tasks that she had undertaken. She would not throw up her\n",
       "part because her mother and Jack had so cruelly injured her; it was now for\n",
       "her father and for the crippled children alone that she did it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sitting in her bedroom with its many books and photographs, the big framed\n",
       "one of her father over her bed, she promised him, her eyes on his, that\n",
       "she would have strength to face it all, for all her life if necessary. \"It\n",
       "was too easy, I see that now,\" she whispered to him. \"I had made no real\n",
       "sacrifices for _our_ thing. The drop of black blood had never yet been\n",
       "crushed out of my heart,--for when you died, it was submission that was\n",
       "asked of me, not sacrifice. It was easy, dear, to give myself to the work\n",
       "we believed in--to be tired, and strong, and glad for it--to live out\n",
       "bravely into the world--when you were beside me and when all the means of\n",
       "work were in my hand. But now I must relinquish something that I could\n",
       "only keep by being false to myself--to you--to the right. And I must go\n",
       "uphill--'yes, uphill to the very end'--accepting poverty, loneliness, the\n",
       "great need of love, unanswered. But I won't falter or forget, darling\n",
       "father. As long as I live I will fight our fight. Even if the way is\n",
       "through great darkness, I carry the light in my heart.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The noble pathos of such soliloquies brought her to tears, but the tears,\n",
       "she felt, were strengthening and purifying. After drying them, after\n",
       "reading some of the deeply marked passages in the poets that he and\n",
       "she,--and, oh, alas! alas! she and Jack, lost Jack--had so often read\n",
       "together, she would go down-stairs, descend into the dusty, thorny arena\n",
       "again, feeling herself uplifted, feeling a halo of sorrowful benignity\n",
       "about her head. And this feeling was so assured that those who saw her at\n",
       "these moments were forced, to some extent, to share it.\n",
       "\n",
       "Toward her mother, toward Jack, she showed a gentle, a distant courtesy;\n",
       "to Mary a heartbreaking sweetness. Mary, perhaps, needed to have pettier\n",

       "\n",
       "If she had been wrong in that strange little scene of the Antigone, Mary\n",

       "the scenes, passages between mother and daughter that had made Imogen's\n",
       "attitude inevitable. So Mary argued with herself, sadly troubled. \"Oh,\n",
       "Imogen, please tell me,\" she burst forth one day, the day before the\n",

       "\n",
       "\"He adores you as much as ever,--of course I've always known how he adored\n",

       "her figure, her outstretched hands; she looked young, she looked almost\n",
       "childlike, as she smiled at her friend over their clasp, and Jack saw, by\n",
       "the light of that transfiguration, how gray these last months must have\n",
       "been to her, how strangely bereft of response and admiration, how without\n",
       "savor or sweetness. He saw, and with the insight came a sharp stir of\n",
       "bitterness against the new-comer, who threw them all like this into a dull\n",
       "background, and, at the same time, a real echo of her gladness, that she\n",
       "should have it.\n",
       "\n",
       "He actually, in the sharp, swift twist of feeling, hardly remembered\n",
       "Imogen's forecasts and warnings, hardly remembered that Mrs. Upton's\n",
       "gladness and Sir Basil's beaming gaze put Imogen quite dreadfully in the\n",
       "right. He did not think of Imogen at all, nor of the desecration of the\n",
       "house of mourning by this gladness, so absorbed was he in watching it, in\n",
       "sharing it, and in being hurt by it.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mrs. Wake, of course, is an old friend,\" Valerie said, leading Sir Basil\n",
       "up to the tea-table; \"and here is a new one--Jack Pennington, whom you must\n",
       "quite know already, I've written so much about him. Sit down here. Tell me\n",
       "all about everything. Why this sudden appearance? Why no hint of it? Is it\n",
       "meant as a surprise for us?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, Frances and Tom were coming over, you knew that--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Of course. I wrote Frances a steamer letter the day before yesterday. You\n",

       "you again.\" Sir Basil, while his beam seemed to include the room and its\n",
       "inmates, included them unseeingly; he had eyes, it was evident, only for\n",
       "her. He went on to give her messages from the Pakenhams, in New York but\n",
       "for a week on their way to Canada and eager to see her at once. They would\n",
       "have come with him had they not been rather knocked up by the early rise on\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh, so I sha'n't see her till to-morrow. I've always been a bit afraid of\n",
       "Miss Upton, you know,\" said Sir Basil, with a smile at Jack.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I don't know about that,\" Sir Basil objected, folding a slice of bread and\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Gruesome?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She stuck so to her own ideas, didn't she? Awfully rough on the poor\n",

       "brothers.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie laughed. \"Well, but that sense of duty is hardly gruesome; it would\n",
       "have been horridly gruesome to have left her brothers unburied.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You'll worst me in an argument, of course,\" Sir Basil replied, looking\n",
       "fondly at her; \"but I maintain that she's a dreary young lady. Of course I\n",
       "don't mean to say that she wasn't an exceedingly good girl, and all that\n",
       "sort of thing, but a bit of a prig, you must allow.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack listened to the bantering colloquy. This man, so hard, yet so kindly,\n",
       "so innocent, yet so mature, was making him feel by every tone, gesture,\n",
       "glance, oddly boyish and unformed. He was quite sure that he himself was a\n",
       "great deal cleverer, a great deal more conscious, than Sir Basil; but these\n",
       "advantages somehow assumed the aspect of schoolboy badges of good conduct\n",
       "beside a grown-up standard. And, as he listened, he began to understand far\n",
       "more deeply all sorts of things about Valerie; to see what vacancies she\n",
       "had had to put up with, to see what fullness she must have missed. And he\n",
       "began to understand what Imogen, Cassandra-like, had declared, that the\n",
       "unseasonable fragrance of devotions hovered about her widowed mother; to\n",
       "remember the ominous \"Wait and see.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It showed how far he had traveled when he could recall these words with\n",
       "impatience: could answer them with: \"Well, what of it? Doesn't she deserve\n",
       "some compensation?\"--could quietly place Sir Basil as a no longer hopeless\n",
       "adorer and feel a thrill of satisfaction, in the realization. Yes, sitting\n",
       "here here in the house of mourning he could think these things.\n",
       "\n",
       "But if he was so wide, so tolerant, the very expansion of his sympathies\n",
       "brought them a finer sensitiveness. Only a tendril-like fineness could\n",
       "penetrate the complexities of that deeper vision. He began to think of\n",
       "Imogen, and with a new pity, a new tenderness. How she would be hurt,\n",
       "and how, more than all, she would be hurt by seeing that he, while\n",
       "understanding, while sympathizing, should, helplessly, inevitably, be glad\n",
       "that Sir Basil had come. Poor Imogen,--and poor himself; for where did he\n",
       "stand among all these shiftings of the scene? He, too, knew the drifting\n",
       "loneliness and desolation, and though his heart ached for the old nearness\n",
       "he could not put out his hand to her nor take a step toward her. In\n",
       "himself, in her, was the change, or the mere fate, that held them parted.\n",
       "The wrench had come slowly upon them, but, while he ached with the pain\n",
       "of it, he could already look upon it as accomplished. Only one question\n",
       "remained to be asked:--Would nothing, no change, no fate, draw them again\n",
       "together?\n",
       "\n",
       "For all answer a deep, settled sadness descended upon him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Basil took himself off before Mrs. Wake seemed to think it tactful to\n",
       "depart, and since, soon after, she too went, Jack and Valerie were left\n",
       "alone together.\n",
       "\n",
       "She turned her bright, soft eyes upon the young man and he recognized in\n",
       "them the unseeing quality that he had found in Sir Basil's--that happy\n",
       "preoccupation with inner gladness. She made him think of the bird alighted\n",
       "to sing on the swaying blade; and she made him think of a fountain released\n",
       "from winter and springing through sunlight in a murmur and sparkle of\n",
       "ecstasy. She was young, very young; he almost felt her as young in her\n",
       "gladness as he in his loneliness and pain. Smiling a trifle nervously, he\n",
       "said that he was glad, at last, to see something of her old life. \"Of your\n",
       "real life,\" he added.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My real life?\" she repeated, and her look became more aware of him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes. Of course, in a sense, all this is something outlived, cast aside,\n",
       "for you. You've only taken it up for a bit while you felt that it had a\n",
       "claim upon you; but, once you have settled things, you would,--you would\n",
       "leave us, of course,\" said Jack, still smiling.\n",
       "\n",
       "She was thinking of him now, no longer of herself and of Sir Basil, and\n",
       "perhaps, as she looked at him, at the thin brown face, the light, deep\n",
       "eyes, she guessed at a stir of tears under the smile. It was then as if the\n",
       "fountain sank from its own happy solitude and became a running brook of\n",
       "sweetness, sad, yet merry. She didn't contradict him. She was sorry that\n",
       "she couldn't, yet glad that his statement should be so obviously true.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You mean that I'll go back to my little Surrey cottage, when I settle\n",
       "things?\" she said. \"Perhaps, yes. And you will miss me? I will miss you\n",
       "too, dear Jack. But we will often see each other. And then it may take a\n",
       "long time to settle all you young people.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Her confidence so startled him, so touched him with pity for its blindness,\n",
       "that, swiftly, he took refuge in ambiguity.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, you'll settle us!\" he said, wondering in what that settling would\n",
       "consist, wondering what would happen if Imogen, definitely casting him off,\n",
       "to put the final settling in that form, were left on her mother's hands.\n",
       "She would have to settle Imogen in America and what, in the meanwhile,\n",
       "would become of her \"real\" life?\n",
       "\n",
       "But from the mother's confidence, her radiance, that accepted his speech\n",
       "in its happiest meaning, he guessed that she didn't foresee such a\n",
       "contingency; he even guessed that, were she brought face to face with it,\n",
       "she wouldn't accept its unsettling of her own joy as final. The fountain\n",
       "was too strong to heed such obstacles. It would find its way to the\n",
       "sunlight. Imogen, in time, would have to accept a step-father.\n",

       "from her demeanor at lunch next day he could guess at how it had impressed\n",
       "her. He felt in her an intense, a guarded, excitement, and knew that the\n",
       "news had fallen upon her with a tingling concussion. The sound of the\n",
       "thunder-bolt must reverberate all the louder in Imogen's ears from her\n",
       "consciousness that to Mary's it was soundless, Mary, who had been the\n",

       "eyes. He was too sure that she felt their mutual knowledge as a bond over\n",
       "the recent chasm. The knowledge in his own eyes was far too deep for him to\n",
       "allow her to wade into it; she would simply drown. He was rather ashamed of\n",
       "himself, but he resolutely feigned a cheerful unconsciousness.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are going with your friends, later?\" he asked Valerie, who, he was\n",

       "\n",

       "for poor, frightened Mary's delectation, an impartial gaily sketched little\n",

       "maintaining their own place as donors and in keeping other people in the\n",
       "place of recipients. In their own eyes, I'm quite sure, they are useful,\n",
       "as upholding the structure of English civilization. You'll find them\n",
       "absolutely simple, absolutely self-assured, absolutely indifferent, quite\n",
       "charming,--there's no reason why they shouldn't be; but their good manners\n",
       "are for themselves, not for you,--one must never forget that with the\n",
       "English. Do study them, Mary. We need to keep the fact of them clearly\n",
       "before us, for what they represent is a menace to us and to what we mean.\n",
       "I sometimes think that the future of the world depends upon which ideal\n",

       "comprehension. Already they have infected the cruder types among us.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "These were all sentiments that in the past, Mary felt sure, Jack must have\n",
       "acquiesced in and approved of, and yet she felt surer that Imogen's manner\n",
       "of enunciating them was making Jack very angry. She herself did not find\n",
       "them as inspiring as she might have expected, and looking very much\n",
       "frightened and flurried she murmured that as she was to go back to Boston\n",

       "The heart of her feeling had always remained for him a mystery, and her\n",
       "acquiescence now might mean a great deal, everything, in fact, or it might\n",
       "mean only her gliding composure before a situation that she had power to\n",
       "form as she would. He could observe that her color rose. He knew that she\n",
       "blushed easily. He knew, too, that his own feeling was not hidden from her\n",
       "and that the blush might be for her recognition only; yet he was occupied\n",
       "with the most hopeful interpretations when the curtain rose. A moment after\n",
       "its rising Valerie heard him softly ejaculate, \"I say!\" She could have\n",
       "echoed the helplessly rudimentary, phrase. She, too, gazed, in a stupor\n",
       "of delight; a primitive emotion in it. The white creature standing there\n",
       "before them, with her forward poise, her downcast yet upgazing face, was\n",
       "her child. Valerie, since her return to her home, had given little time\n",
       "to analysis of her own feeling, the stress of her situation had been too\n",
       "intense for leisurely self-observation. But in the upwelling of a strange,\n",
       "a selfless, joy she knew, now, how often she had feared that all the joy of\n",
       "maternity was dead in her; killed, killed by Imogen.\n",
       "\n",
       "The joy now was a passing ray. The happy confusion of admiration, wonder,\n",
       "and pride was blotted out by the falling gloom of reality. It was her\n",
       "child who stood there, but the bond between them seemed, but for the ache\n",
       "of rejected maternity at her heart, a pictorial one merely. Tears of\n",
       "bitterness involuntarily filled her eyes as she looked, and Imogen's form\n",
       "seemed to waver in a dim, an alien atmosphere.\n",
       "\n",
       "When the curtain fell on the Antigone who kept her pose without a tremor,\n",
       "the uproar of applause was so great that it had to rise, not only twice,\n",
       "but three times. At the last, a faint wavering shook slightly the\n",
       "Antigone's sculptured stillness and poor old Oedipus rocked obviously upon\n",
       "his feet.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What a shame to make her keep it up for so long!\" murmured Sir Basil, his\n",
       "face suffused with sympathy. The symptom of human weakness was a final\n",
       "touch to the enchantment.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, it makes one selfish, such loveliness!\" said Mrs. Pakenham, flushed\n",
       "with her clapping. \"Valerie, dear, she is quite too lovely!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Extraordinarily Greek, the whole thing,\" said Tom Pakenham; \"the\n",
       "comparative insignificance of facial expression and the immense\n",
       "significance of attitude and outline.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But the face!\" Sir Basil turned an unseeing eye upon him, still wrapped,\n",
       "it was evident, in the vision that, at last, had disappeared. \"The figure\n",
       "is perfect; but the face,--I never saw anything so heavenly.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Indeed, in its slightly downcast pose, the trivial lines of Imogen's nose\n",
       "and chin had been lost; the up-gazing eyes, the sweep of brow and hair, had\n",
       "dominated and transfigured her somewhat tamely perfect countenance.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do you know, I'm more afraid of her than ever,\" said Sir Basil to Valerie\n",
       "on their way home to tea, in the cab. \"I wasn't really afraid before. I\n",
       "could have borne up very well; but now--it's like knowing that one is to\n",
       "have tea with a seraph.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack, Imogen, and Mary were not yet arrived when they reached the house;\n",
       "but by the time the tea was on the table and Valerie in her place behind\n",
       "the urn, they heard the cab drive up and the feet of the young people on\n",
       "the stairs.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack entered alone, saying that Mary and Imogen were gone to take off their\n",
       "wraps. Yes, he assured Valerie, they had promised to keep on their Grecian\n",
       "robes for tea.\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie introduced him to the Pakenhams and led the congratulations on his\n",
       "triumph. \"For it really is yours, Jack, as much as if you had painted the\n",
       "whole series of pictures.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack, looking shy, turned from one to the other as they seconded her\n",
       "enthusiasm,--Mrs. Pakenham, with her elaborately formal head and china-blue\n",
       "eyes; her husband, robust and heavy; Sir Basil, still with his benignant,\n",
       "unseeing quality. Among them all, in spite of Mrs. Wake's keen, familiar\n",
       "visage, in spite of Valerie's soft glow, he felt himself a stranger. He\n",
       "even felt, with a little stab of ill-temper, that there had been truth\n",
       "in Imogen's diagnosis. They were kindly, but they were tremendously\n",
       "indifferent. They didn't at all expect you to be interested in them; but\n",
       "that hardly atoned for the fact that they weren't interested in you. For\n",
       "Jack, life was made up of vigilant, unceasing interest, in himself and in\n",
       "everybody else.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, were they all taken from your pictures?\" Sir Basil asked him,\n",
       "strolling up to the mantelpiece to examine a photograph of Imogen that\n",
       "stood there.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack explained that he could claim no such gallery of achievement. He had\n",
       "made a few sketches for each tableau; his work had been, in the main, that\n",
       "of stage-manager.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, I see,\" said Sir Basil, not at all abashed by his blunder. \"Nicer than\n",
       "lay figures to work with, eh? all those pretty young women.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I don't use lay figures, at any time. I'm a landscape painter,\" Jack\n",
       "explained, somewhat stiffly. He surmised that had he been introduced as\n",
       "Velasquez Sir Basil would have been quite as unmoved, just as he would have\n",
       "been quite as genially inclined had he been introduced as a scene-painter.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I used to think I'd go in for something of that sort in my young days,\"\n",
       "said Sir Basil, holding Imogen's photograph; \"and I dabbled a bit in\n",
       "water-color for a time. Do you remember that little sketch of the Hall,\n",
       "done from the beech avenue, Mrs. Upton? Not so bad, was it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not at all bad,\" said Valerie; \"but we can't use such negatives for Jack's\n",
       "work. It's very seriously good, you know. It's anything but dabbling.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, yes; I know that you are a real artist,\" Sir Basil smiled at Jack from\n",
       "the photograph. \"This doesn't do her justice, does it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Imogen? No; it's a frightful thing,\" said Jack over-emphatically.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Pakenham asked to see it and pronounced that, for her part, she\n",
       "thought it excellent.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You ought to paint her portrait,\" Sir Basil continued, looking at Jack,\n",
       "who had, once more, to explain that landscape was his only subject. He\n",
       "guessed from the something at once benign and faintly quizzical in Sir\n",
       "Basil's regard, that to all these people he was significant, in the main,\n",
       "as Imogen's lover, and the intuition vexed him still further.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen's entrance, startling in its splendid incongruity, put an end to his\n",
       "self-consciousness and absorbed him in contemplation.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen revealed herself newly, even to him, to-day. It wasn't the old\n",
       "Imogen of stateliness, graciousness, placidity, nor the later one of gloom\n",
       "and anger. This Imogen, lovely, with her flushed cheeks and sparkling eyes,\n",
       "was deeply excited, deeply self-forgetful. She, too, was absorbed in her\n",
       "intense curiosity, her feverish watchfulness.\n",
       "\n",
       "She said nothing while her mother introduced her to the new-comers, who all\n",
       "looked a little taken aback, as though the resuscitated Grecian heroine\n",
       "were indeed among them, and stood silently alert near the tea-table,\n",
       "handing the cups of tea, the cakes and scones, for Jack and Sir Basil\n",
       "to pass round. Her arms were bare and her slender bare feet, laced with\n",
       "gold-clasped fastenings, showed on her white sandals. Jack saw that Sir\n",
       "Basil's eyes were fixed on her with an expression of wonder.\n",
       "\n",
       "He asked her, as he took the last cup from her, if she were not cold, and,\n",
       "gentle, though unsmiling, Imogen replied, \"Oh, no!\" glancing at the roaring\n",
       "wood fire, that illuminated her whiteness as if with a sacrificial glow.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Do sit down and have your tea, Imogen; you must be very tired,\" her mother\n",
       "said, with something of the chill that the scene at the lunch-table had\n",
       "diffused still in her voice.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not very, thanks, mama dear,\" said Imogen; and, more incongruous in\n",
       "loveliness than before, she sat down in a high-backed chair at some little\n",
       "distance from the tea-table. Sir Basil, as if with a sort of helplessness,\n",
       "remained beside her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, it was a great success, wasn't it?\" Jack heard her replying\n",
       "presently, while she drank the tea with which Sir Basil had eagerly\n",
       "supplied her. \"I'm so glad.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You liked doing it, didn't you? You couldn't have done it, like\n",
       "that--looked like that, if you hadn't cared a lot about it,\" Sir Basil\n",
       "pursued.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen smiled a little and said that she didn't know that she had liked\n",
       "doing her part particularly,--it was of her crippled children that she was\n",
       "thinking. \"We'll be able to get the Home now,\" she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It was for cripple children?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Didn't you know? I should have thought mama would have told you. Yes, it\n",
       "all meant that, only that, to me. We gave the tableaux to get enough money\n",
       "to buy a country home for them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You go in a lot for good works, I know,\" said Sir Basil, and Imogen,\n",
       "smiling again, with the lightness rooted in excitement, answered: \"They go\n",
       "in for me, rather. All the appeals of suffering seem to come to one and\n",
       "seize one, don't they? One never needs to seek causes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack watched them talk, Imogen, the daughter of the dead, rejected husband,\n",
       "and Sir Basil, her mother's suitor.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mary had come in now, late from changing her dress, which at the last\n",
       "moment she had felt too shy to appear in. She was talking to Mrs. Wake and\n",
       "the Pakenhams.\n",
       "\n",
       "Standing, a somewhat brooding onlooker, becoming conscious, indeed, of the\n",
       "sense, stronger than ever, of loneliness and bereavement, he heard Mrs.\n",
       "Upton near him say, \"Sit down here, Jack.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She showed him a chair beside her, in the corner, between her tea-table,\n",
       "the window, and the fire. She, too, was for the moment isolated; she, too,\n",
       "no doubt, had been watching; and now she talked to him, not at all as if\n",
       "she had felt that he were lonely and were making it up to him, but, once\n",
       "more, like the child happily gathering and holding out nosegays to another\n",
       "child.\n",
       "\n",
       "A controlled excitement was in her, too; and he felt still that slight\n",
       "strain of the lunch-table, as if Imogen's catafalque had marred some\n",
       "too-trustful assurance; but a growing warmth was diffused through it, and,\n",
       "as her eyes turned once or twice on Imogen and Sir Basil, he saw the cause.\n",
       "\n",
       "The possibility that her daughter might make friends with her suitor, the\n",
       "solvent, soothing possibility that, if realized, would so smooth her path,\n",
       "had come to her. And in their quiet fire-lit corner, shut the closer into\n",
       "their isolation by the talk that made only a confused murmur about them, he\n",
       "felt a new frankness in her, as though the hope of the hour effaced ominous\n",
       "memories and melted her reserves and discretions, making it wholly natural\n",
       "to draw near him in the implied avowal of shared outlooks.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I believe that Imogen and Sir Basil are going to get on together,\" she\n",
       "said; \"I believe that she likes him already. I so want them to be friends.\n",
       "He is such a friend of mine.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"They look friendly,\" said Jack; \"I think I can always tell when Imogen is\n",
       "going to like people.\" He did not add that, with his new insight about\n",
       "Imogen, he had observed that it was people over whom she had power that\n",
       "Imogen liked. And already he seemed to see that Imogen would have some sort\n",
       "of power over Sir Basil.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And I can always tell when he is going to like people. He thinks her\n",
       "wonderful,\" said Valerie. She exchanged her knowledge with him; it was\n",
       "touching, the way in which, blind to deep change in him, she took for\n",
       "granted his greater claim to the interpretation of Imogen. She added: \"It\n",
       "is a very propitious beginning, I think.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How long is Sir Basil going to stay here?\" Jack asked.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"All summer. He goes to Canada with the Pakenhams, and out to the West, for\n",
       "a glimpse of the changes since he was here years and years ago; and then I\n",
       "want him to come to Vermont, to us. You and Imogen will both get to know\n",
       "him well there. Of course you are coming; Imogen told me that she asked you\n",
       "long ago.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes; I shall enjoy that immensely,\" the young man answered, with, for his\n",
       "own consciousness, a touch of irrepressible gloom. He didn't look forward\n",
       "to the continuation of the drama, to his own lame and merely negative part\n",
       "in it, at the close quarters of a house-party among the Vermont hills.\n",
       "\n",
       "And as if Valerie bad felt the inner doubt she added suddenly, on a\n",
       "different key, \"You really will enjoy it, won't you?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He looked up at her. Her face, illuminated by the firelight, though dimmed\n",
       "against the evening blue outside, was turned on him with its sudden\n",
       "intentness and penetration of gaze.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why, of course,\" he almost stammered, confused by the unexpected scrutiny.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I shall love having you, you know,\" she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I shall love being with you,\" he answered, now without a single inner\n",
       "reserve.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her intentness seemed to soften, there was solicitude and a sort of\n",
       "persuasiveness in it. \"And you will have a much better chance of really\n",
       "adjusting things there--your friendship with Imogen, I mean. The country\n",
       "smoothes things out. Things get sweet and simple.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He didn't know what to say. Her mistake, if it were one, was so inevitable.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Imogen will have taken her bearings by then,\" she went on. \"She has had so\n",
       "much to get accustomed to, to bear with, poor child; her great bereavement,\n",
       "and--and a mother who, in some ways, must always be a trial to her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, a trial!\"--Jack lamely murmured.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I recognize it, Jack. I think that you do. But when she makes up her mind\n",
       "to me, and discovers that, at all events, I don't interfere with anything\n",
       "that she really cares about, she will be able to take up all her old\n",
       "threads again.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I--I suppose so,\" Jack murmured.\n",
       "\n",
       "He had dropped his eyes, for he knew that hers were on him. And now, in a\n",
       "lowered voice, he heard her say, \"Jack, I hope that you will help me with\n",
       "Imogen.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Help you? How do you mean?\" startled, he looked up.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You know. Interpret me to her now and then, when you can, with kindliness.\n",
       "You understand me so much more kindly than she does.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "His eyes fixed on hers, deeply flushing--\"Oh, but,\"--he breathed out with\n",
       "almost a long sigh,--\"that's what I have done, you see, ever since--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ever since what?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Since I came to understand you so much better than she does.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "There was a long pause now and, the firelight flickering low, he could\n",
       "hardly see her face. But he recognized change in her voice as she said:\n",
       "\"You have? I don't mean, you know, taking my side in disputes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I know; I don't mean that, either, though, perhaps, I can't help doing it;\n",
       "for,\" said Jack, \"it's on your side that I am, you know.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The change in her voice, but controlled, kept down, she answered quickly,\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, but, dear Jack, I don't want to have a side. It's that that I want her\n",
       "to realize. I want her to feel that my side is hers. I want you to help me\n",
       "in making her feel it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But she'll never feel it!\" Jack breathed out again. Behind the barrier\n",
       "of the tea-table, in the flickering dimness, they were speaking suddenly\n",
       "with a murmuring, yet so sharp a confidence; a confidence that in broad\n",
       "daylight, or in complete solitude, might have seemed impossible. All sorts\n",
       "of things must steal out in that persuasive, that peopled yet solitary,\n",
       "twilight.\n",
       "\n",
       "He knew that Valerie's eyes dwelt on him with anxiety and that it was with\n",
       "a faint, forced smile that she asked him: \"She doesn't think that I'll ever\n",
       "reach her side?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"_I_ don't believe you ever will,\" said Jack. Then, for he couldn't bear\n",
       "that she should misunderstand him for another moment, misunderstanding\n",
       "when they had come so far was too unendurable, he went on in a hurried\n",
       "undertone: \"You aren't on her side, really. You can never be on her side.\n",
       "You can never be like her, or see like her. And I don't want you to. It's\n",
       "you who see clearly, not she. It's you who are all right.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Her long silence, after this, seemed to him like the hovering of hands upon\n",
       "him; as though, in darkness, she sought by touch to recognize some strange\n",
       "object put before her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But then,--\" she, too, only breathed it out at last,--\"but then,--you are\n",
       "not on _her_ side.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That's just it,\" said Jack. He did not look at her and she was silent once\n",
       "more before his confession.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But,\" she again took up the search, \"that is terrible for her, if she\n",
       "feels it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And for me, too, isn't it?\" he questioned, as if he turned the surfaces of\n",
       "the object beneath her fingers.\n",
       "\n",
       "The soft, frightened hover seemed to go all over it, to recognize it\n",
       "finally, and to draw back, terrified, from recognition.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Most terrible of all for me, if I have come between you,\" she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her pain pierced him so, that he put out his hand and took hers. Don't\n",
       "think that; you mustn't think that, not for a moment. It's not that you\n",
       "came between us. It's only that, because of you, I began to see things--as\n",
       "I hadn't seen them. It was just,--well, just like seeing one color change\n",
       "when another is put beside it. Imogen's blue, now that your gold has come,\n",
       "is turned to green; that's all that has happened.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"All that has happened! Do you know what you are saying, Jack! If my gold\n",
       "were gone, would the blue come back again?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The blue will never come back,\" said Jack.\n",
       "\n",
       "He felt, as her hand tightened on his, that he would have liked to put his\n",
       "head down on her knees and sob like a little boy; but when she said, \"And\n",
       "the green you cannot care for?\" his own hand tightened as if they clutched\n",

       "\n",
       "For a moment, in her deep anger,--horror running through it, too, as though\n",
       "the very bottom had dropped out of things and she saw emptiness beneath\n",
       "her,--she thought that she would tell him to leave her there, forever. But\n",
       "Imogen's intelligence was at times a fairly efficacious substitute for\n",
       "deeper promptings; and humiliation, instead of enwrapping her mind in a\n",
       "flare of passionate vanity, seemed, when such intellectual apprehension\n",
       "accompanied it, to clarify, to steady her thoughts. She saw, now, in the\n",
       "sudden uncanny illumination, that in all her vehemence of this afternoon\n",
       "there had been something fictitious. The sorrow, the resentment on her\n",
       "father's account, she had, indeed, long felt; too long to feel keenly.\n",
       "Her disapproval of the second marriage was already tinctured by a certain\n",
       "satisfaction; it would free her of a thorn in the flesh, for such her\n",
       "mother's presence in her life had become, and it would justify forever her\n",
       "sense of superiority. It was all the clearest cause for indignation that\n",
       "her mother had given her, and, seeing it as such, she had longed to make\n",
       "Jack share her secure reprobation; but she hadn't, really, been able to\n",
       "feel it as she saw it. It solved too many problems and salved too many\n",
       "hurts. So now, standing there under the arch of wistaria, she saw through\n",
       "herself; saw, at the very basis of her impulse, the dislocation that\n",
       "had made its demonstration dramatic and unconvincing. Dreadful as the\n",
       "humiliation was, her lips growing parched, her throat hot and dry with it,\n",
       "her intelligence saw its cause too clearly for her to resent it as she\n",
       "would have resented one less justified. There was, perhaps, something to\n",
       "be said for Jack, disastrously wrong though he was; and, with all her\n",

       "\n",
       "So, at the moment of their deepest hostility, Jack was to have his sweetest\n",

       "expected; she didn't overwhelm him with an icy torrent of reproach and\n",
       "argument. Instead, as she stood there against her halo of black, the long\n",
       "regard of her white face fixed on him, her eyes suddenly filled with tears.\n",
       "She didn't acquiesce for a moment, or, for a moment, imply him anything but\n",
       "miserably, pitiably wrong; but in a voice from which every trace of anger\n",

       "Imogen and Sir Basil were walking down a woodland path under the sky of\n",
       "American summer, a vast, high, cloudless dome of blue. Trees, tall and\n",
       "delicate, in early June foliage, grew closely on the hillside; the grass of\n",
       "the open glades was thick with wild Solomon's-seal, and fragile clusters of\n",
       "wild columbine grew in the niches and crannies of the rocks, their pale-red\n",
       "chalices filled with fantastically fretted gold.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen, dressed in thin black lawn, fine plaitings of white at throat and\n",
       "wrists, her golden head uncovered, walked a little before Sir Basil with\n",
       "her long, light, deliberate step. She had an errand in the village two\n",
       "miles away, and her mother had suggested that Sir Basil should go with her\n",
       "and have some first impressions of rural New England. He had only arrived\n",
       "the night before. Miss Bocock and the Pottses were expected this afternoon,\n",
       "and Mrs. Wake had been for a fortnight established in her tiny cottage on\n",
       "the opposite hillside.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Tell me about your village here,\" Sir Basil had said, and Imogen, with\n",
       "punctual courtesy and kindness, the carrying out of her promise to Jack,\n",
       "had rejoined: \"It would be rather uneventful annals that I should have to\n",
       "tell you. The people are palely prosperous. They lead monotonous lives.\n",
       "They look forward for variety and interest, I think, to the summer, when\n",
       "all of us are here. One does all one can, then, to make some color for\n",
       "them. I have organized a kindergarten for the tiny children, and a girls'\n",
       "club for debates and reading; it will help to an awakening I believe. I'm\n",
       "going to the club this afternoon. I'm very grateful to my girls for helping\n",
       "me as they do to be of use to them. It's quite wonderful what they have\n",
       "done already. Our village life is in no sense like yours in England, you\n",
       "know; these people are all very proud and independent. It's as a friend,\n",
       "not as a Lady Bountiful, that I go among them.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I see,\" said Sir Basil, with interest, \"that's awfully nice all round.\n",
       "I wish we could get rid of a lot of stupid ways of thought at home. I'll\n",
       "see something of these friends of yours at the house, then. I'm immensely\n",
       "interested in all these differences, you know.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You won't see them at the house. Our relation is friendly, not social.\n",
       "That is a froth that doesn't count.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh! and they don't mind that--not having the social relation, I mean--if\n",
       "they are friends?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why should they? I am not hurt because they do not ask me to their picnics\n",
       "and parties, nor are they because I don't ask them to my dinners and teas.\n",
       "We both understand that all that is a matter of manner and accident; that\n",
       "in essentials we are equal.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I see; but,\" Sir Basil still queried, \"you wouldn't care about their\n",
       "parties, I suppose, and don't you think they might like your dinners? At\n",
       "least that's the way it would work out, I'm afraid, at home.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, it doesn't here. They are too civilized for that. Neither of us would\n",
       "feel fitted to the superficial aspects of the others' lives.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We have that sort of thing in England, too, you know; only perhaps we\n",
       "look at it more from the other side, and recognize difference rather than\n",
       "sameness.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very much more, I think,\" said Imogen with a slight smile. \"I should\n",
       "think that there was very little resemblance. Your social structure is\n",
       "a wholesome, natural growth, embodying ideals that, in the main, are\n",
       "unconscious. We started from that and have been building ever since toward\n",
       "conscious ideals.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well,\"--Sir Basil passed over this simile, a little perplexed,--\"it's very\n",
       "wonderful that they shouldn't feel--inferior, you know, in our ugly sense\n",
       "of the word, if they only get one side of friendship and not the other. Now\n",
       "that's how we manage in England, you see; but then I'm afraid it doesn't\n",
       "work out as you say it does here; I'm afraid they do feel inferior, after a\n",
       "fashion.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Only the truly inferior could feel inferiority, since they get the real\n",
       "side of friendship,\" said Imogen, with gentle authority. \"And I can't think\n",
       "that, in our sense of the word, the real side is given with you. There is\n",
       "conscious condescension, conscious adaptation to a standard supposed\n",
       "lower.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I see; I see\"; Sir Basil murmured, looking, while still perplexed, rather\n",
       "conscience-stricken; \"yes, I suppose you're right.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen looked as though she more than supposed it, and, feeling himself\n",
       "quite worsted, Sir Basil went on to ask her further questions about the\n",
       "club and kindergarten.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What a lot of work it must all mean for you,\" he said.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That, I think, is one's only right to the advantages one has--education,\n",
       "taste, inherited traditions,\" said Imogen, willing to enlighten this\n",
       "charmingly civilized, yet spiritually barbarous, interlocutor who followed\n",
       "her, tall, in his delightfully outdoor-looking garments, his tie and the\n",
       "tilt of his Panama hat answering her nicest sense of fitness, and his\n",
       "handsome brown face, quizzical, yet very attentive, meeting her eyes on\n",
       "its leafy background whenever she turned her head. \"If they are not made\n",
       "instruments to use for others they rust in our hands and poison us,\" she\n",
       "said. \"That's the only real significance of an aristocracy, a class fitted\n",
       "to serve, with the highest service, the needs of all. Of course, much of\n",
       "our best and deepest thought about these things is English; don't imagine\n",
       "me ungrateful to the noble thinkers of your--of my--race,--they have\n",
       "moulded and inspired us; but, there is the strange paradox of your\n",
       "civilization, your thought reacts so little on your life. Your idealists\n",
       "and seers count only for your culture, and even in your culture affect so\n",
       "little the automatic existence of your people. They form a little isolated\n",
       "class, a leaven that lies outside the lump. Now, with us, thought rises,\n",
       "works, ferments through every section of our common life.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Quite without fire, almost indolently, she spoke; very simply, too,\n",
       "glancing round at him, as though she could not expect much understanding\n",
       "from such an alien listener.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I'm awfully glad, you know, to get you to talk to me like this,\" said Sir\n",
       "Basil, after a meditative pause; \"I saw a good bit of you in New York, but\n",
       "you never talked much with me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You had mama to talk to.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But I want to talk to you, too. You do a lot of thinking, I can see that.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I try to\"; she smiled a little at his _naïveté_.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Your mother told me so much about you that I'm tremendously eager to know\n",
       "you for myself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, I hope that you may come to, for mama's pictures of me are not\n",
       "likely to be accurate,\" said Imogen mildly. \"We don't think in the same way\n",
       "or see things in the same way and, though we are so fond of each other, we\n",
       "are not interested in the same things. Perhaps that is why I don't interest\n",
       "her particular friends. They would not find much in common between mama and\n",
       "me\"; but her smile was now a little humorous and she was quite prepared for\n",
       "his \"Oh, but, I assure you, I am interested in you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Already, with her unerring instinct for power, Imogen knew that Sir Basil\n",
       "was interested in her. There was only, to be sure, a languid pleasure in\n",
       "the sense of power over a person already, as it were, so bespoken, so in\n",
       "bondage to other altars; but, though without a trace of coquetry, the smile\n",
       "quietly claimed him as a partial, a damaged convert. Imogen always knew\n",
       "when people were capable of being, as she expressed it to herself, \"Hers.\"\n",
       "She made small effort for those who were without the capacity. She never\n",
       "misdirected such smiles upon Rose, or Miss Bocock, or Mrs. Wake. And now,\n",
       "as Sir Basil went on to asseverate, just behind her shoulder, his pleasant\n",
       "tones quite touched with eagerness, that the more he saw of her the more\n",
       "interested he became, she allowed him to draw her into a playful argument\n",
       "on the subject.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, I quite believe that you would like me--if you came to know me\"--she\n",
       "was willing to concede at last; \"but, no, indeed no, I don't think that you\n",
       "would ever feel much interest in me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You mean because I'm not sufficiently interesting myself? Is that it, eh?\"\n",
       "Sir Basil acutely asked, reflecting that he had never seen a girl walk so\n",
       "beautifully or dress so exquisitely. The sunlight glittered in her hair.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I don't mean that at all,\" said Imogen; \"although I don't fancy that you\n",
       "are interested so deeply, and in so many things, as I am.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Now, really! Why not? You haven't given me a chance to show you. Of course\n",
       "I'm not clever.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I meant nothing petty, like cleverness.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You mean that I don't take life seriously enough to please you?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not that, exactly. It's that we face in opposite directions, as it were.\n",
       "Life isn't to you what it is to me, it isn't to you such a big, beautiful\n",
       "thing, with so many wonderful vistas in it--such far, high peaks.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She was very grave now, and the gravity, the assurance, and, with them, the\n",
       "sweetness, of this young girl were charming and perplexing to Sir Basil.\n",
       "Girls so assured he had found harsh, disagreeable and, almost always, ugly;\n",
       "they had been the sort of girl one avoided. And girls so lovely had usually\n",
       "been coy and foolish. This girl walked like a queen, looked at one like a\n",
       "philosopher, smiled at one like an angel. He fixed his mind on her last\n",
       "words, rallying his sense of quizzical paternity to meet such disconcerting\n",
       "statements.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, but you are very young; life looks like that--peaks, you know, and\n",
       "vistas, and all the rest--when one is young. You've not had time to find it\n",
       "out, to be disappointed,\" said Sir Basil.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen's calm eye rested upon him, and even before she spoke he knew that\n",
       "he had made a very false step. It was as if, sunken to the knees in his\n",
       "foolish bog, he stood before her while she replied:\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, it's that that is shallow in you, or, let us say, undeveloped, still\n",
       "to be able to think of life in those terms. They are the thoughts of an\n",
       "unawakened person, and some people, I know, go all through life without\n",
       "awaking. You imagine, I suppose, that I think of life as something that\n",
       "is going to give me happiness, to fulfil sentimental, girlish dreams. You\n",
       "are mistaken. I have known bitter disappointments, bitter losses, bitter\n",
       "shatterings of hope. But life is wonderful and beautiful to me because\n",
       "we can be our best and do our best in it, and for it, if we try. It's an\n",
       "immense adventure of the soul, an adventure that can disappoint only in the\n",
       "frivolous sense you were thinking of. Such joys are not the objects of our\n",
       "quest. One is disappointed with oneself, often, for falling so short of\n",
       "one's vision, and people whom we love and trust may fail us and give us\n",
       "piercing pain; but life, in all its oneness, is good and beautiful if we\n",
       "wake to its deepest reality and give our hearts to the highest that we\n",
       "know.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She spoke sadly, softly, surely, thinking of her own deep wounds, and to\n",
       "speak such words was almost like repeating a familiar lesson,--how often\n",
       "she had heard them on her father's lips,--and Sir Basil listened, while he\n",
       "looked at the golden head, at the white hand stretched out now and then to\n",
       "put aside a branch or sapling--listened with an amazement half baffled and\n",
       "wholly admiring. He had never heard a girl talk like that. He had heard\n",
       "such words before, often, of course, but they had never sounded like this;\n",
       "they seemed fresh, and sparkling with a heavenly dew, spoken so quietly,\n",
       "with such indifference to their effect, such calmness of conviction. The\n",
       "first impression of her, that always hovered near, grew more strongly upon\n",
       "him. There was something heavenly about this girl. It was as though he had\n",
       "heard an angel singing in the woods, and a feeling of humility stole over\n",
       "him. It was usual for Sir Basil, who rarely thought about himself, to feel\n",
       "modest, but very unusual for him to feel humble.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You make me believe it, when you say it,\" he murmured. \"I'm afraid you\n",
       "think me a dreadfully earthy, commonplace person.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen, at the change of note in his voice, looked round at him, more\n",
       "really aware of him than she had been at all, and when she met his glance\n",
       "the prophet's calm fervor rose in her to answer the faith that she felt in\n",
       "him. She paused, letting him come abreast of her in the narrow path, and\n",
       "they both stood still, looking at each other.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are not earthy; you are not commonplace,\" said Imogen, then, as a\n",
       "result of her contemplation. \"I believe that you are a very big person, Sir\n",
       "Basil.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"A big person? How do you mean?\" He absolutely flushed, half abashed, half\n",
       "delighted.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen continued to gaze, clearly and deeply. \"There are all sorts of\n",
       "possibilities in you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, come now! At my age! Why, any possibilities are over, except for a\n",
       "cheerful kind of vegetating.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have vegetated all your life, I can see that. No one has ever waked\n",
       "you. You have hardly _used_ your soul at all. It's with you as it is with\n",
       "your country, whose life is built strongly and sanely with body and brain\n",
       "but who has not felt nationally, as a whole, its spirit. Like it, you have\n",
       "a spirit; like it, you are full of possibilities.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Upton, you aren't like anybody I've ever known. What sort of\n",
       "possibilities?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She walked on now, feeling his thrill echo in herself, symptomatic of the\n",
       "passing forth of power and its return as enrichment of life and inspiration\n",
       "to helpfulness. \"Of service,\" she said. \"Of devotion to great needs;\n",
       "courage in great causes. I don't think that you have ever had a chance.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Basil, keeping his eyes on her straight, pale profile, groping and\n",
       "confused in this new flood of light, wondered if he had.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You are an extraordinary young woman,\" he said at last. \"You make me\n",
       "believe in everything you say, though it's so awfully queer, you know, to\n",
       "think in that way about myself. If you talk to me often like this, about\n",
       "needs and causes, will it give me more of a chance, do you think?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We must all win to the light for ourselves,\" said Imogen very gently, \"but\n",
       "we can help one another.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "They had come now to the edge of the wood and out upon the white road that\n",
       "curved from the village up to the blue of the hills they had descended. A\n",
       "tiny brook ran with a sharp, silvery tinkle on its farther edge and it was\n",
       "bordered by a light barrier of white railing. Beyond were spacious,\n",
       "half-cultivated meadows, stretched out for miles in the lap of low-lying\n",
       "hills.\n",
       "\n",
       "Serene yet inhuman the landscape looked, a background to the thinnest of\n",
       "histories, significant only of its own dreaming solitude; and the village,\n",
       "among its elms, a little farther on, suggested the barest past, the most\n",
       "barren future. The road led on into its main street, where the elms made\n",
       "a stately avenue, arching over scattered frame houses of buff and gray\n",
       "and white. Imogen told Sir Basil that some of these houses were old, and\n",
       "pointed out an austere classic façade with pediment and pillars; explained\n",
       "to him, too, the pathetic condition of so much of abandoned New England.\n",
       "Sir Basil was thinking more of her last words in the woods than of local\n",
       "color, but he had, while he listened, a fairly definite impression of\n",
       "pinchbeck shops; of shabby awnings slanting in the sunlight over heaps of\n",
       "tumbled fruit and vegetables; of \"buggies,\" slip-shod, with dust-whitened\n",
       "wheels, the long-tailed, long-maned, slightly harnessed horses hitched to\n",
       "posts along the pavements. The faces that passed were indolent yet eager.\n",
       "The jaws of many worked mechanically at some unappeasing task of\n",
       "mastication.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Basil had traveled since his arrival in America, had seen the luxuries\n",
       "of the Atlantic seacoast, the purposeful energy of Chicago, California's\n",
       "Eden-like abundance, and had seen other New England villages where beauty\n",
       "was cherished and made permanent. He hardly needed Imogen's further\n",
       "comments to establish his sense of contrast.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This was always a poor enough little place. Any people who made it count\n",
       "left it long ago. But even here,\" she went on, \"even in its stagnation, one\n",
       "can find some of the things we care for in our country, some of the things\n",
       "we live for.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Some of these things seemed personified in the figure of the young woman\n",
       "who met them in the girls' club, among the shelves of books and the\n",
       "numerous framed photographs from the old masters. Imogen introduced\n",
       "Sir Basil to her and he watched her with interest while she and Imogen\n",
       "discussed some business matters. She was slender and upright, perhaps too\n",
       "upright; she was, in manner, unaffected and assured, perhaps too assured,\n",
       "but that Sir Basil did not observe. He found her voice unpleasant and her\n",
       "pronunciation faulty, but thought that she expressed herself with great\n",
       "force and fluency. Her eyes were bright, her skin sallow, she smiled\n",
       "gravely, and her calmness and her smile reminded Sir Basil a little of\n",
       "Imogen; perhaps they were racial. She was dressed in a simple gray cotton\n",
       "frock with neat lawn collar and cuffs, and her hair was raised in a\n",
       "lustrous \"pompadour,\" a wide comb traversing it behind and combs at the\n",
       "sides of her head upholding it in front. Toward Sir Basil she behaved with\n",
       "gracious stateliness of demeanor, so that he wondered anew at the anomalies\n",
       "of a country of ideals where a young person so well-appearing should not be\n",
       "asked to dinner.\n",
       "\n",
       "Several other girls came in while they were there, and they all surrounded\n",
       "Imogen with eager familiarity of manner; all displayed toward himself, as\n",
       "he was introduced, variations of Miss Hickson's stateliness. He thought\n",
       "it most delightful and interesting and the young women very remarkable\n",
       "persons. One discordant note, only, was struck in the harmony, and\n",
       "that discord was barely discerned by his untrained ear. While Imogen\n",
       "was talking, a girl appeared in the doorway, hesitated, then, with an\n",
       "indifferent and forbidding manner, strolled across the room to the\n",
       "book-shelves, where she selected a book, strolling out again with the\n",
       "barest nod of sullen recognition. She was a swarthy girl, robust and ample\n",
       "of form, with black eyes and dusky cheeks. Her torn red blouse and untidy\n",
       "hair marked her out from the sleek and social group. Sir Basil thought her\n",
       "very interesting looking. He asked Imogen, as they walked away under the\n",
       "elms, who she was. \"That artistic young person, with the dark hair.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Artistic? Do you mean Mattie Smith?--the girl with the bad manners?\" asked\n",
       "Imogen, smiling tolerantly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, she looked like a clever young person. She belongs to the club?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She hardly counts as one of its members, though we welcome everyone, and,\n",
       "like all the girls of the village, she enjoys the use of our library. She\n",

       "with very little of the spirit of sisterhood in her. And she nurses her\n",

       "to wider, sweeter outlooks some day.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mattie Smith, however, was one of the people upon whom Imogen wasted no\n",
       "smiles. On the Uptons first coming to spend their summers near Hamborough,\n",
       "Imogen had found this indolent yet forcible personality barring her path\n",
       "of benignant activity. Mattie Smith, unaided, undirected, ignorant of the\n",
       "Time Spirit's high demands upon the individual, had already formed a club\n",
       "of sorts, a tawdry little room hung with bright bunting and adorned with\n",
       "colored pictures from the cheaper magazines, pictures of over-elegant,\n",
       "amorously inclined young couples in ball-rooms or on yachts and beaches.\n",
       "Here the girls read poor literature, played games, made candy over the\n",
       "stove and gossiped about their young men. Imogen deeply disapproved of the\n",
       "place; its ventilation was atrocious and its moral influence harmful; it\n",
       "relaxed and did not discipline,--so she had expressed it to her father. It\n",
       "soon withered under her rival beams. Mattie Smith's members drifted by\n",
       "degrees into the more advantageous alliance. Mattie Smith had resented this\n",
       "triumphant placing of the higher standard and took pains, as Imogen, with\n",
       "the calm displeasure of the successful, observed, to make difficulties\n",
       "for her and to treat her with ostentatious disregard. Imogen guessed very\n",
       "accurately at the seething of anger and jealousy that bubbled in Mattie\n",
       "Smith's breast; it was typical of so much of the lamentable spirit\n",
       "displayed by rudimentary natures when feeling the pressure of an ideal they\n",
       "did not share or when brought into contact with a more finished manner of\n",
       "life from which they were excluded. Imogen, too, could not have borne a\n",
       "rival ascendancy; but she was ascendant through right divine, and, while so\n",
       "acutely understanding Mattie Smith's state of mind, she could not recognize\n",
       "a certain sameness of nature. She hoped that Mattie Smith would \"grow,\" but\n",

       "\n",
       "It was almost four o'clock by the time that Imogen and Sir Basil reached\n",
       "the summit of one of the lower hills, and, among the trees, came upon the\n",
       "white glimmer of the Upton's summer home. It stood in a wide clearing\n",
       "surrounded on three sides by the woods, the higher ranges rising about it,\n",
       "its lawn running down to slopes of long grass, thick with tall daisies\n",
       "and buttercups. Farther on was an orchard, and then, beyond the dip of a\n",
       "valley, the blue, undulating distance, bathed in a crystalline quivering.\n",
       "The house, of rough white stucco, had lintels and window-frames of dark\n",
       "wood, a roof of gray shingles, and bright green shutters. A wide veranda\n",
       "ran around it, wreathed in vines and creepers, and borders of flowers\n",
       "grew to the edges of the woods. Sir Basil thought that he had never seen\n",
       "anything prettier. Valerie, dressed in thin black, was sitting on the\n",
       "veranda, and beside her Miss Bocock, still in traveling dress, looked\n",
       "incongruously ungraceful. She had arrived an hour before with the Pottses,\n",
       "who had gone to their rooms, and said, in answer to Imogen's kindly\n",
       "queries, that the journey hadn't been bad, though the train was very\n",
       "stuffy. Then it appeared that Miss Bocock and Sir Basil were acquainted;\n",
       "they recollected each other, shook hands heartily, and asked and answered\n",
       "local questions. Miss Bocock's people lived not so many miles from Thremdon\n",
       "Hall, and, though she had been little at home of late years, she and Sir\n",
       "Basil had country memories in common. She said presently that she, too,\n",
       "would like to tidy for the tea, and Imogen, taking her to her room, sat\n",
       "with her while she smoothed out one section of her hair and tonged the\n",
       "other, and while she put on a very stiff holland skirt and a blouse\n",
       "distressing to Imogen's sensitive taste, a crude pink blouse, irrelevantly\n",
       "adorned about the shoulders with a deep frill of imitation lace. While she\n",
       "dressed she talked, in her high-pitched, cheerful voice, of the recent very\n",
       "successful lectures she had given in Boston and the acquaintances she had\n",
       "made there.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I hope that my letters of introduction proved useful,\" said Imogen. She\n",
       "considered Miss Bocock her _protégée_, but Miss Bocock, very vexatiously,\n",
       "seemed always oblivious of that fact; so that Imogen, though feeling that\n",
       "she had secured a guest who conferred luster, couldn't resist, now and\n",
       "then, trying to bring her to a slightly clearer sense of obligation.\n",
       "\n",
       "Miss Bocock said that, yes, they had been very useful, and Imogen watched\n",
       "her select from the graceful nosegay on her dressing-table two red roses\n",
       "which she pinned to her pink blouse with a heavy silver brooch\n",
       "representing, in an encircling bough, a mother bird hovering with\n",
       "outstretched wings over a precariously placed nest.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Let me get you a white rose,\" Imogen suggested; but Miss Bocock said, no,\n",
       "thanks, she was very fond of that shade of red.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"So you know Sir Basil,\" said Imogen, repressing her sense of irritation.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Know him? Yes, of course. Everybody in the county knows him. He is the big\n",
       "man thereabouts, you see. The old squire, his father, was very fond of my\n",
       "father, and we go to a garden-party at the hall once a year or so. It's a\n",
       "nice old place.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen felt some perplexity. \"But if your father and his were such friends\n",
       "why don't you see more of each other?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Miss Bocock looked cheerfully at her. \"Why, because he is big and we\n",
       "aren't. We are middle-class and he very much upper; it's a very old family,\n",
       "the Thremdons,--I forget for how many generations they have been in Surrey.\n",
       "Now my dear old dad was only a country doctor,\" Miss Bocock went on, seated\n",
       "in a rocking-chair--she liked rocking-chairs--with her knees crossed, her\n",
       "horribly shaped patent-leather shoes displayed and her clear eyes, through\n",
       "their glasses, fixed on Imogen while she made these unshrinking statements;\n",
       "\"and a country doctor's family hasn't much to do with county people.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What an ugly thing,\" said Imogen, while, swiftly, her mind adjusted itself\n",
       "to this new seeing of Miss Bocock. By its illumination Miss Bocock's\n",
       "assurance toward herself grew more irritating than before, and the fact\n",
       "that Miss Bocock's flavor was very different from Sir Basil's became\n",
       "apparent.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not at all,\" said Miss Bocock. \"It's a natural crystallization. You are\n",
       "working toward the same sort of thing over here--only not in such a\n",
       "wholesome way, I think.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen flushed a little. \"Our crystallizations, when they aren't\n",
       "artificially brought about by apings of your civilization, take place\n",
       "through real superiority and fitness. A woman of your intellectual ability\n",
       "is anybody's equal in America.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, as far as that goes, in that sense, I'm anybody's equal in England,\n",
       "too,\" said Miss Bocock, unperturbed and unimpressed.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen rather wished she could make her feel that, since crystallizations\n",
       "were a fact, the Uptons, in that sense, were as much above her as the\n",
       "Thremdons. Idealist democrat as she counted herself, she had these quick\n",
       "glances at a standard kept, as it were, for private use; as if, from under\n",
       "an altar in the temple of humanity, its priest were to draw out for some\n",
       "personal reassurance a hidden yard-measure.\n",
       "\n",
       "Tea, when they went down again, was served on the veranda and Imogen could\n",
       "observe, during its progress, that Miss Bocock showed none of the\n",
       "disposition to fawn on Sir Basil that one might have expected from a person\n",
       "of the middle-class. She contradicted him as cheerfully as she did Imogen\n",
       "herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. and Mrs. Potts had gone for a little ramble in the lower woods,\n",
       "but they soon appeared, Mr. Potts seating himself limply on the steps\n",
       "and fanning himself with his broad straw hat--a hat that in its very\n",
       "largeness and looseness seemed to express the inflexible ideals of\n",
       "non-conformity--while Mrs. Potts, very firmly busked and bridled, her head\n",
       "very sleek, her smile very tight, took a chair between Mrs. Upton and Sir\n",
       "Basil, and soon showed, in her whole demeanor, a consciousness of the\n",
       "latter's small titular decoration that placed her more definitely for\n",
       "Imogen's eye than she had ever been placed before. The Pottses were\n",
       "middle-class with a vengeance. Imogen's irritation grew as she watched\n",
       "these limpet-like friends, one sprawling and ill-at-ease for all his\n",
       "careful languor, the other quite dreadfully well-mannered, sipping her\n",
       "tea, arching her brows and assuming all sorts of perilous elegancies of\n",
       "pronunciation that Imogen had never before heard her attempt. It was an\n",
       "additional vexation to have them display toward herself, with even more\n",
       "exaggeration than usual, their tenacious tenderness; listening, with a\n",
       "grave turning of head and eye when she spoke, and receiving each remark\n",
       "with an over-emphasis of feeling on their over-mobile features.\n",
       "\n",
       "There was, indeed, an odd irony in the Pottses being there at all. They\n",
       "had, in her father's lifetime, only been asked with a horde of their kind,\n",
       "the whole uplifted batch thus worked off together, and Imogen had really\n",
       "not expected her mother to agree to her suggestion that they should be\n",
       "invited to pay the annual visit during Sir Basil's stay. She would not own\n",
       "to herself that her suggestion had been made from a vague wish to put her\n",
       "mother to a test, to force her into a definite declaration against the\n",
       "incongruous guests; she had thought of the suggestion, rather, as an\n",
       "upholding of her father's banner before the oncoming betrayal; but, instead\n",
       "of refusal, she had met with an instant, happy acquiescence, and it was now\n",
       "surely the climax of irony to see how her mother, for her sake, bore with\n",
       "them. More than for her sake, perhaps. Imogen detected in those seemingly\n",
       "indolent, yet so observant, eyes a keen reading of the Pottses' perturbed\n",
       "condition, and in her manner, so easy and so apt, the sweetest, lightest\n",
       "kindness. She turned corners and drew veils for them, spread a warm haze\n",
       "of interest and serenity about their clumsy and obtruding personalities.\n",
       "Imogen could even see that the Pottses were reconsidering, with some\n",
       "confusion of mind, their old verdict on her mother.\n",
       "\n",
       "This realization brought to her brooding thoughts a sudden pang of\n",
       "self-reproach. It wouldn't do for the Pottses to find in her mother the\n",
       "cordiality they might miss in herself. She confessed that, for a moment,\n",
       "she had allowed the banner to trail in the dust of worldly thoughts, the\n",
       "banner to which the Pottses, poor dears, had rallied for so many loyal\n",
       "years. She summoned once more all her funds of spiritual appreciation and\n",
       "patience. As for Miss Bocock, she made not the slightest attempt to talk\n",
       "to the Pottses. She had come up with them from the station,--they had not\n",
       "found each other on the train,--and she had probably had her fill of them\n",
       "in that time. Once or twice, in the act of helping herself plentifully to\n",
       "cake, she paused to listen to them, and after that looked away, over their\n",
       "heads or through them, as if she finally dismissed them from the field of\n",
       "her attention. Mrs. Potts was questioning Sir Basil about his possible\n",
       "knowledge of her own English ancestry. \"We came over in the _Mayflower_,\n",
       "you know,\" she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Really,\" said Sir Basil, all courteous interest.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The Claremonts, you know,\" said Mrs. Potts, modestly, yet firmly, too. \"My\n",
       "father was in direct descent; we have it all worked out in our family\n",
       "tree.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, really,\" said Sir Basil again.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I've no doubt,\" said Mrs. Potts, \"that your forebears and mine, Sir Basil,\n",
       "were friends and comrades in the spacious times of good Queen Bess.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen, at this, glanced swiftly at her mother; but she caught no trace of\n",
       "wavering on that mild countenance.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, well, no,\" Sir Basil answered. \"My people were very little country\n",
       "squires in those days; we didn't have much to do with the Dukes of\n",
       "Claremont. We only began to go up, you see, a good bit after you were on\n",
       "the top.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen fixed a calm but a very cold eye upon Mrs. Potts. She had heard\n",
       "of the Dukes of Claremont for many years; so had everybody who knew Mrs.\n",
       "Potts; they were an innocent, an ingrained illusion of the good lady's, but\n",
       "to-day they seemed less innocent and more irritating than usual. Imogen\n",
       "felt that she could have boxed Mrs. Potts's silly ears. In Sir Basil's\n",
       "pleasant disclaimers, too, there was an echo of Miss Bocock's\n",
       "matter-of-fact acknowledgments that seemed to set them both leagues away\n",
       "from the Pottses and to make their likeness greater than their difference.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, of course,\" Mrs. Potts was going on, her _pince-nez_ and all her\n",
       "small features mingled, as it were, in the vividest glitter, \"for me, I\n",
       "confess, it's blood, above all and beyond all, that counts; and you and I,\n",
       "Sir Basil, know that it is in the squirearchy that some of the best blood\n",
       "in England is found. We don't recognize an aristocracy in our country, Sir\n",
       "Basil, but, though not recognized, it rules,--blood must rule; one often,\n",
       "in a democracy, feels that as one's problem.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It's only through service that it rules,\" Mr. Potts suddenly ejaculated\n",
       "from where he sat doubled on the steps looking with a gloomy gaze into the\n",
       "distance. \"Service; service--that's our watchword. Lend a hand.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen saw a latent boredom piercing Sir Basil's affability. Great truths\n",
       "uttered by some lips might be made to seem very unefficacious. She proposed\n",
       "to him that she should show him the wonderful display of mountain-laurel\n",
       "that grew higher up among the pine-woods. He rose with alacrity, but Mrs.\n",
       "Potts rose too. Imogen could hardly control her vexation when, nipping the\n",
       "crumbs from her lap and smoothing the folds at her waist, she declared that\n",
       "she was just in the humor for a walk and must see the laurel with them.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You mustn't tire yourself. Wouldn't you rather stay and have another cup\n",
       "of tea and talk to me?\" Mrs. Upton interposed, so that Imogen felt a dart\n",
       "of keen gratitude for such comprehension; but Mrs. Potts was not to be\n",
       "turned aside from her purpose. \"Thank you so much, dear Mrs. Upton,\" she\n",
       "answered; \"we must have many, many talks indeed; but I do want to see my\n",
       "precious Imogen, and to see the laurel with her. You are one of those rare\n",
       "beings, darling Imogen, with whom one can _share_ nature. Will you come,\n",
       "too, Delancy, dear?\" she asked her husband, \"or will you stay and talk to\n",
       "Mrs. Upton and Miss Bocock? I'm sure that they will be eager to hear of\n",
       "this new peace committee of ours and zestful to help on the cause.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Potts rather sulkily said that he would stay and talk to Mrs. Upton and\n",
       "Miss Bocock about the committee, and Imogen felt that it was in a manner of\n",
       "atonement to him for her monopolization of a lustrous past that Mrs. Potts\n",
       "presently, as they began the steep ascent along a winding, mossy path, told\n",
       "Sir Basil that her husband, too, knew the responsibility and burden of\n",
       "\"blood.\" And as, for a moment, they went before her, Imogen fancied that\n",
       "she heard the murmur of quite a new great name casting its ægis about Mr.\n",
       "Potts. Very spiritual people could, she reflected, become strangely\n",
       "mendacious when borne along on the wings of ardor and exaltation.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Potts's presence was really quite intolerable, and, as she walked\n",
       "behind her and listened to her murmur, Imogen bethought her of an amusing,\n",
       "though rather ruthless, plan of elimination. Imogen was very capable of\n",
       "ruthlessness when circumstances demanded it. Turning, therefore, suddenly\n",
       "to the right, she led them into a steep and rocky path that, as she well\n",
       "knew, would eventually prove impassable to Mrs. Potts's short legs and\n",
       "stiff, fat person. Indeed, Mrs. Potts soon began to pant and sigh. Her\n",
       "recital of the family annals became disconnected; she paused to take off\n",
       "and rub her eyeglasses and presently asked, in extenuated tones, if this\n",
       "were the usual path to the laurel.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It's the one I always take, dear Mrs. Potts; it's the one I wanted Sir\n",
       "Basil to see, it's so far the lovelier. One gets the most wonderful, steep\n",
       "views down into far depths of blue,\" Imogen, perched like a slender\n",
       "Valkyrie on the summit of a crag above, thus addressed her perturbed\n",
       "friend.\n",
       "\n",
       "She couldn't really but be amused by Mrs. Potts's pertinacity, for, not\n",
       "yet relinquishing her purpose, she continued, in silence now, her lips\n",
       "compressed, her forehead beaded with moisture, to scale the difficult way,\n",
       "showing a resolute nimbleness amazing in one so ill-formed for feats of\n",
       "agility. Sir Basil gave her a succoring hand while Imogen soared ahead,\n",
       "confident of the moment when Mrs. Potts, perforce, must fall back.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Tiresome woman!\" she thought, but she couldn't help smiling while she\n",
       "thought it, and heard Mrs. Potts's deep breath laboring up behind her. It\n",
       "was, perhaps, rather a shame to balk her in this way; but, after all, she\n",
       "was to have a full fortnight of Sir Basil and she, Imogen, felt that\n",
       "on this day, the day of a new friendship, Sir Basil's claim on her was\n",
       "paramount. She had something for him, a light, a strengthening, and she\n",
       "must keep the hour sacred to that stir of awakening. Among the pines and\n",
       "laurels she would say a few more words of help to him. So that Mrs. Potts\n",
       "must be made to go.\n",
       "\n",
       "The moment came. A shoulder of rock overhung the way and the only passage\n",
       "was over its almost perpendicular surface. Imogen, as if unconscious of\n",
       "difficulty, with a stride, a leap, a swift clutch of her firm white hand,\n",
       "was at the top, smiling down at them and saying: \"Now here the view is our\n",
       "very loveliest. One looks down for miles.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But--my dear Imogen--is there no other way, round it, perhaps?\" Mrs. Potts\n",
       "looked desperately into the thick underbrush on either side.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No other way,\" said Imogen. \"But you can manage it. This is only the\n",
       "beginning,--there's some real climbing farther on. Put your foot where I\n",
       "did--no, higher--near the little fern--your hand here, look, do you see?\n",
       "Take a firm hold of that--then a good spring--and here you are.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Poor Mrs. Potts laid a faltering hand on the high ledge that was only a\n",
       "first stage in the chamois-like feat, and Imogen saw unwilling\n",
       "relinquishment in her eye.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I don't see as I can do it,\" she murmured, relapsing, in her distress,\n",
       "into a helpless vernacular.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, yes, this is nothing. Sir Basil will give you a push. I'll pull you\n",
       "and he will push you,\" Imogen, with kindest solicitude, suggested.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, I don't see as I _can_,\" Mrs. Potts repeated, looking rather wild at\n",
       "the vision of such a push. She didn't at all lend herself to pushes, and\n",
       "yet, facing even the indignities of that method, she did, though faltering,\n",
       "place herself in position; did lay a desperate hold of the high ledge,\n",
       "place her small, fat, tightly buttoned foot high beside the fern; allow Sir\n",
       "Basil, with a hand under each armpit, to kindly count \"One-two-three--now\n",
       "for it!\"--did even, at the word of command, make a passionate jump, only to\n",
       "lose hold, scrape lamentably down the surface of the rock, and collapse\n",
       "into his arms.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, I'm so sorry!\" said Imogen, looking down upon them while Sir Basil\n",
       "placed Mrs. Potts upon her feet, and while Mrs. Potts, angered almost to\n",
       "tears, rubbed with her handkerchief at the damage done to her dress. \"I'm\n",
       "so _very_ sorry, dear Mrs. Potts. I see that it is a little too steep for\n",
       "you. And I did so want you to see this view.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I shall have to go back. I am very tired, quite exhausted,\" said Mrs.\n",
       "Potts, in a voice that slightly shook. \"I wish you had taken the usual\n",
       "path. I never dreamed that we were setting out on such a--such a violent\n",
       "expedition.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But this is my usual path,\" said Imogen, opening her eyes. \"I've never\n",
       "found it hard. And I wanted you and Sir Basil to see my view. But, dear\n",
       "Mrs. Potts, let me go back with you. Sir Basil won't mind finding his way\n",
       "alone, I'm sure.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, no, thanks! No, I couldn't think of spoiling your walk. No, I will go\n",
       "back,\" and Mrs. Potts, turning away, began to retrace her steps.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Be sure and lie down and rest; take a little nap before dinner,\" Imogen\n",
       "called after her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Potts disappeared, and Imogen, when she and Sir Basil stood together\n",
       "on the fortunate obstacle, said: \"Poor, excellent creature. I _am_ sorry.\n",
       "She is displeased with me. I ought to have remembered that this was too\n",
       "rough for her and taken the other path.\" Indeed, she had felt rather guilty\n",
       "as Mrs. Potts's back, the ridge of its high stays strongly marked by the\n",
       "slanting sunlight, descended among the sylvan scenery.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, and she did so want to come, awfully keen on it,\" said Sir Basil;\n",
       "\"but I hope you won't think me very brutal if I confess that _I'm_ not\n",
       "sorry. I want to talk to you, you see,\" Sir Basil beamed.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I would rather talk to you, too,\" Imogen smiled. \"My good old friend can\n",
       "be very wearisome. But it was thoughtless of me to have brought her on this\n",
       "way.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "They rested for a little while on their rock, looking down into the\n",
       "distance that was, indeed, worth any amount of climbing. And afterward,\n",
       "when they reached the fairyland where the laurel drifted through the pine\n",
       "woods, and as she quoted \"Wood-Notes\" to him and pointed out to him the\n",
       "delicate splendors of the polished green, the clear, cold pink, on a\n",
       "background of gray rock, Imogen could but feel her little naughtiness well\n",
       "justified. It was delightful to be there in solitude with Sir Basil, and\n",
       "the sense of sympathy that grew between her and this supplanter of her\n",
       "father's was strange, but not unsweet. It wasn't only that she could help\n",
       "him, and that that was always a claim to which one must respond, but she\n",
       "liked helping him.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the downward way, a little tired from the rapidity of her ascent, she\n",
       "often gave her hand to Sir Basil as she leaped from rock to rock, and they\n",
       "smiled at each other without speaking, already like the best of friends.\n",
       "\n",
       "That evening, as she was going down to dinner, Imogen met her mother on the\n",
       "stairs. They spoke little to each other during these days. Imogen felt that\n",
       "her neutrality of attitude could best be maintained by silence.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mrs. Potts came back,\" her mother said, smiling a little, and, Imogen\n",
       "fancied, with the old touch of timidity that she remembered in her. \"She\n",
       "said that you took her on a most fearful climb.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What foolishness, poor dear Mrs. Potts! I took her along the upper path.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The upper path! Is there an upper path?\" Mrs. Upton descended beside her\n",
       "daughter. \"I thought that it was the usual path that had proved too much\n",
       "for her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I wanted them to see the view from the rock,\" said Imogen; \"I forgot that\n",
       "poor Mrs. Potts would find it too difficult a climb.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, I remember, now, the rock! That is a difficult climb,\" said Mrs.\n",
       "Upton.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen wondered if her mother guessed at why Mrs. Potts had been taken on\n",
       "it. She must feel it of good augury, if she did, that her daughter should\n",
       "already like Sir Basil enough to indulge in such an uncharitable freak.\n",
       "Imogen felt her color rise a little as she suspected herself and her\n",
       "motives revealed. It was not that she wasn't quite ready to own to a\n",
       "friendship with Sir Basil; but she didn't want friendship to be confused\n",
       "with condonation, and she didn't like her mother to guess that she could\n",
       "use Mrs. Potts uncharitably.\n",

       "\n",
       "Her magnanimity toward Jack--so Imogen more and more clearly saw it to have\n",
       "been--at the time of their parting, had made it inevitable that he should\n",
       "hold to his engagement to visit them that summer, and even because of that\n",
       "magnanimity, she felt, in thinking over again and again the things that\n",
       "Jack had said of her and to her, a deepening of the cold indignation that\n",
       "the magnanimity had quelled at the moment of his speaking them. Mingling\n",
       "with the sense of snapped and bleeding ties was a longing, irrepressible,\n",
       "profound, violent, that he might be humiliated, punished, brought to his\n",
       "knees in penitence and abasement.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her friendship with Sir Basil, his devotion to her, must be, though by no\n",
       "means humiliating, something of a coal of fire laid on Jack's traitorous\n",
       "head; and she saw at once that he was pleased, touched, but perplexed, by\n",
       "what must seem to him an unforeseen smoothing of her mother's path. He was\n",
       "there, she guessed, far more to see that her mother's path was made smooth\n",
       "than to try and straighten out their own twisted and separate ways. He had\n",
       "come for her mother, not for her; and Imogen did not know whether it was\n",
       "more pain or anger that the realization gave her.\n",
       "\n",
       "What puzzled him, what must have puzzled her mother, must puzzle, indeed,\n",
       "anyone who perceived it,--except, no doubt, the innocent Sir Basil\n",
       "himself,--was that this friendship took up most of Sir Basil's time.\n",
       "\n",
       "To Sir Basil she stood for something lofty and exquisite that did not,\n",
       "of course, clash with more rudimentary, if deeper, affections, but that,\n",
       "perforce, made them stand aside for the little interlude where it soared\n",
       "and sang. There was, for Imogen, a sharp sweetness in this fact and in\n",
       "Jack's bewildered appreciation of it, though for her own consciousness\n",
       "the triumph was no satisfying one. After all, of what use was it to soar\n",
       "and sing if Sir Basil were to drop to earth so inevitably and so soon?\n",
       "Outwardly, at all events, this unforeseen change in the situation gave her\n",
       "all the advantage in her meeting with Jack. She was not the reproved and\n",
       "isolated creature that he might have expected to find. She was not the\n",
       "helpless girl, subjugated by an alien mother and cast off by a faithless\n",
       "lover. No; calm, benignant, lovely, she had turned to other needs; one was\n",
       "not helpless while one helped; not small when others looked up to one.\n",
       "\n",
       "Under her calm was the lament; under her unfaltering smile, the loneliness\n",
       "and the burning of that bitter indignation; but Jack could not guess at\n",
       "that, and if both felt difficulty in the neatly balanced friendship pledged\n",
       "under the wisteria, if there was a breathlessness for both in the\n",
       "tight-rope performance,--where one false step might topple one over into\n",
       "open hostility, or else, who knew, into complete surrender,--it was Imogen\n",
       "who gained composure from Jack's nervousness, and while he walked the rope\n",
       "with a fluttering breath and an anxious eye she herself could show the most\n",
       "graceful slides and posturings in midair.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was evident enough to everybody that the relation was a changed, a\n",
       "precarious one, but all the seeming danger was Jack's alone.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen, while she swung and balanced, often found her mother's eye fixed\n",
       "on her with a deep preoccupation, and guessed that it was owing to her\n",
       "mother's tactics that most of her _tête-à-têtes_ with Jack were due. Her\n",
       "poor mother might imagine that she thus secured the solid foundation of\n",
       "the earth for their footsteps, but Imogen knew that never was the rope so\n",
       "dizzily swung as when she and Jack were thus gently coerced into solitude\n",
       "together.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was, however, a few days after Jack's arrival, and a few days before\n",
       "the Pottses' departure, that an interest came to her of such an absorbing\n",
       "nature that it wrapped her mind away from the chill or scorching sense\n",
       "of her own wrongs. It was with the Pottses that the plan originated, and\n",
       "though the Pottses were proving more trying than they had ever been, they\n",
       "caught some of the radiance of their own proposal. As instruments in a\n",
       "great purpose, she could look upon them more patiently, though, more than\n",
       "ever, it would need tact to prevent them from shadowing the brightness that\n",
       "they offered. The plan, apparently, had been with them for some time, its\n",
       "disclosure delayed until the moment suited to its seriousness and sanctity,\n",
       "and it was then, between the three, mapped out and discussed carefully\n",
       "before they felt it ripe for further publicity. Then it was Imogen who told\n",
       "them that the time had come for the unfolding to her mother, and Imogen who\n",
       "led them, on a sunny afternoon, into her mother's little sitting-room where\n",
       "she sat writing at her desk.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack was there, reading near the window that opened upon the veranda, but\n",
       "his presence was not one to make the occasion less intimate, and Imogen was\n",
       "glad of it. It was well that he should be a witness to what she felt to be\n",
       "a confession of faith, a confession that needed explicit defining, and of a\n",
       "faith that he and all the others, by common consent, seemed banded together\n",
       "to ignore.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, with something of the air of a lovely verger, she led her primed pair\n",
       "into the room and pointed out two chairs to them.\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie, in her thin black draperies, looked pale and jaded. She turned\n",
       "from her desk, keeping her pen in her hand, and Imogen detected in her eye,\n",
       "as it rested upon the Pottses, a certain impatience.\n",
       "\n",
       "Tison, suddenly awakening, broke into passionate barking; he had from the\n",
       "moment of Mr. Potts's arrival shown toward him a pronounced aversion, and,\n",
       "backed under the safe refuge of his mistress's chair, his sharp hostility\n",
       "disturbed the ceremonious entrance.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Please put the dog out, Jack,\" said Imogen; \"we have a very serious matter\n",
       "to talk over with mama.\" But Valerie, stooping, caught him up, keeping a\n",
       "soothing hand on his still defiant head, while Mr. Potts unfolded the plan\n",
       "before her.\n",
       "\n",
       "The wonderful purpose, the wonderful project, was that Mr. Potts, aided by\n",
       "Imogen, should write the life of the late Mr. Upton; and as the curtain was\n",
       "drawn from before the shrined intention, Imogen saw that her mother flushed\n",
       "deeply.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"His name must not be allowed to die from among us, Mrs. Upton. His ideals\n",
       "must become more widely the ideals of his countrymen.\" Mr. Potts, crossing\n",
       "his knees and throwing back his shoulders, wrapped one hand, while he\n",
       "spoke, in a turn of his flowing beard. \"They are in crying need of such a\n",
       "message, now, when the tides of social materialism and political corruption\n",
       "are at their height. We may well say, to paraphrase the great poet's\n",
       "words: 'Upton! thou shouldst be living at this hour; New York hath need of\n",
       "thee.' And this need is one that it is our duty, and our high privilege,\n",
       "to satisfy.\" Mr. Potts's eye, heavy with its responsibility, dwelt on\n",
       "Valerie's downcast face. \"No one, I may say it frankly, Mrs. Upton, is\n",
       "more fitted than I to satisfy that need and to hand on that message. No\n",
       "one had more opportunity than I for understanding that radiant personality\n",
       "in its public aspects. No one can feel more deeply than I that duty and\n",
       "that privilege. Every American child should know the name of Upton;\n",
       "every American man and woman should count him among the prophets of his\n",
       "generation. He did not ask for fame, and we, his followers, ask none for\n",
       "him. No marble temple, no effulgent light of stained glass;--no. But the\n",
       "violets and lilies of childhood laid upon his grave; the tearful, yet\n",
       "joyous whisper of those who come to share his spirit:--'I, too, am of his\n",
       "race. I, too, can with him strive and with him achieve.'\" Mr. Potts's voice\n",
       "had risen, and Tison, once more, gave a couple of hoarse, smothered barks.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen, though reared on verbal bombast, had found some difficulty in\n",
       "maintaining her expression of uplifted approbation while Mr. Potts's\n",
       "rhetoric rolled; her willingness that Mr. Potts should serve the cause did\n",
       "not blind her to his inadequacy unless kept under the most careful control;\n",
       "and now, though incensed by Tison's interjection, she felt it as something\n",
       "of a relief, seizing the opportunity of Mr. Potts's momentary confusion\n",
       "to suggest, in a gentle and guarded voice:--\"You might tell mama now, Mr.\n",
       "Potts, how we want her to help us.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am coming to that, Miss Imogen,\" said Mr. Potts, with a drop from\n",
       "sonority to dryness;--\"I was approaching that point when the dog\n",
       "interrupted me\"; and Mr. Potts cast a very venomous glance upon Tison.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Had not the dog better be removed, Mrs. Upton?\" Mrs. Potts, under her\n",
       "breath, murmured, leaning, as if in a pew and above prayer books, forward\n",
       "in her chair. But Mrs. Upton seemed deaf to the suggestion.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Potts cleared his throat and resumed somewhat tersely:--\"This is our\n",
       "project, Mrs. Upton, and we have come this afternoon to ask you for your\n",
       "furtherance of it. You, of course, can provide me and Miss Imogen with\n",
       "many materials, inaccessible otherwise, for this our work of love. Early\n",
       "letters, to you;--early photographs;--reminiscences of his younger days,\n",
       "and so on. Any suggestion as to the form and scope of the book we will be\n",
       "glad, very glad, to consider.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie had listened without a word or gesture, her pen still held in one\n",
       "hand, Tison pressed to her by the other, as she sat sideways to the\n",
       "writing-table. Imogen read in her face a mingled embarrassment and\n",
       "displeasure.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am sure we must all be very grateful to Mr. Potts for this great idea of\n",
       "his, mama dear,\" she said. \"I thought of it, of course, as soon as papa\n",
       "died; I knew that we all owed it to him, and to the country that he loved\n",
       "and served so well; but I did not see my way, and have not seen it till\n",
       "now. I've so little technical knowledge. But now I shall contribute a\n",
       "little memoir to the biography and, in any other way, give Mr. Potts all\n",
       "the aid I can. And we hope that you will, too. Papa's name is one that must\n",
       "not be allowed to fade.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I would rather talk of this at some other time, and with Mr. Potts alone,\"\n",
       "Valerie now said, not raising her eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But mama, this is my work, too. I must be present when it is talked of.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, Jack, don't go,\" said Valerie, looking up at the young man, who had\n",
       "made a gesture of rising. \"You and I, Imogen, will speak of this together,\n",
       "and I will find an hour, later, when I will be free to talk to Mr. Potts.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mama darling,\" said Imogen, masking her rising anger in patient\n",
       "playfulness, \"you are a lazy, postponing person. You are not a bit busy,\n",
       "and this is just the time to talk it over with us all. Of course Jack must\n",
       "stay; we want his advice, too, severe critic as we know him to be. Come,\n",
       "dear, put down that pen.\" She bent over her and drew the pen from her hand\n",
       "while Mr. Potts watched the little scene, old suspicions clouding his\n",
       "countenance.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My time is limited, Mrs. Upton,\" he observed; \"Mrs. Potts and I take our\n",
       "departure to-morrow and, if I have heard aright, you expect acquaintances\n",
       "to dinner. Therefore, if you will pardon me, I must ask you to let us have\n",
       "the benefit, here and now, of your suggestions.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie had not responded by any smile to Imogen's rather baleful\n",
       "lightness, nor did she, by any penitence of look, respond to Mr. Potts's\n",
       "urgency. She sat silent for a moment, and when she spoke it was in a\n",
       "changed voice, dulled, monotonous. \"If you insist on my speaking, now--and\n",
       "openly,--I must say to you that I altogether disapprove of your project.\n",
       "You will never,\" said Valerie, with a rising color, \"gain my consent to\n",
       "it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "A heavy silence followed her words, the only sound that of Tison's faint\n",
       "sniffings, as, his nose outstretched and moving from side to side, he\n",
       "cautiously savored the air in Mr. Potts's direction. Mrs. Potts stirred\n",
       "slightly, and uttered a sharp, \"Tht--tht.\" Mr. Potts, his hand still stayed\n",
       "in his beard, gazed from under the fringed penthouse of his brows with an\n",
       "arrested, bovine look.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was Imogen who broke the silence. Standing beside her mother she had\n",
       "felt the shock of a curious fulfilment go through her, as if she had almost\n",
       "expected to hear what she now heard. She mastered her voice to ask:--\"We\n",
       "must demand your reasons for this--this very strange attitude, mama.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Her mother did not raise her eyes. \"I don't think that your father was a\n",
       "man of sufficient distinction to justify the publishing of his biography.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "At this Mr. Potts breathed a deep, indignant volume of sound, louder than a\n",
       "sigh, less articulate than a groan, through the forests of his beard.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Sufficient distinction, Mrs. Upton! Sufficient distinction! You evidently\n",
       "are quite ignorant of how great was the distinction of your late husband.\n",
       "Ask us what that distinction was--ask any of his large circle of friends.\n",
       "It was a distinction not of mind only, nor of birth and breeding--though\n",
       "that was of the highest that this country has fostered--but it was a\n",
       "distinction also of soul and spirit. Your husband, Mrs. Upton, fought with\n",
       "speech and pen the iniquities of his country, the country that, as Miss\n",
       "Imogen has said, he loved and served. He served, he loved, with mind and\n",
       "heart and hand. He was the moving spirit in all the great causes of his\n",
       "day, the vitalizing influence that poured faith and will-power into them.\n",
       "He founded the cooperative community of Clackville; he organized the\n",
       "society of the 'Doers' among our young men;--he was a patron of the arts;\n",
       "talent was fostered, cheered on its way by him;--I can speak personally\n",
       "of three young friends of mine--noble boys--whom he sent to Paris at his\n",
       "own expense for the study of music and painting; when the great American\n",
       "picture is painted, the great American symphony composed, it will be, in\n",
       "all probability, to your husband that the country will owe the unveiling\n",
       "of its power. And above all, Mrs. Upton, above all,\"--Mr. Potts's voice\n",
       "dropped to a thunderous solemnity,--\"his character, his personality, his\n",
       "spirit, were as a light shining in darkness to all who had the good fortune\n",
       "to know him, and that light cannot, shall not, be cribbed, cabined and\n",
       "confined to a merely private capacity. It is a public possession and\n",
       "belongs to his country and to his age.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Tison, all unheeded now, had leapt to the floor and, during this address,\n",
       "had stood directly in front of the speaker, barking furiously until Imogen,\n",

       "flung him out of the room.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Upton had sat quite motionless, only lifting her glance now and then\n",

       "scratching at the door of the banished Tison,--she said in somber\n",
       "tones:--\"I think you forget, Mr. Potts, that I was never one of my\n",
       "husband's appreciators. I am sorry to be forced to recall this fact to your\n",
       "memory.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It had been in all their memories, of course, a vague, hovering\n",
       "uncertainty, a dark suspicion that one put aside and would not look at. But\n",
       "to have it now placed before them, and in these cold, these somber tones,\n",
       "was to receive an icy douche of reality, to be convicted of over-ready\n",
       "hope, over-generous confidence.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was Imogen, again, who found words for the indignant deputation: \"Is\n",

       "\n",

       "to him because you have always failed in yours. _We_ are in no way bound to\n",
       "consider you-who never considered him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Imogen,\" said her mother, raising her eyes with a look of command; \"you\n",

       "But Mr. Potts did not lag behind his duty. His hand still wrapped,\n",
       "Moses-like, in his beard, his eyes bent in holy wrath upon his hostess, he\n",
       "rose to his feet, and Mrs. Potts, in recounting the scene--one of the most\n",
       "thrilling of her life--always said that never had she seen Delancy so\n",
       "superbly _true_, never had she seen blood so _tell_.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I must say to you, Mrs. Upton, with the deepest pain,\" he said, \"that I\n",
       "agree with Miss Imogen. I must inform you, Mrs. Upton, that you have no\n",

       "I may do our duty without your help or consent.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have nothing more to say to you, Mr. Potts,\" Valerie replied. She had,\n",
       "unseeingly, taken up her pen again and, with a gesture habitual to her, was\n",
       "drawing squares and crosses on the blotter under her hand. The lines\n",
       "trembled. The angles of the squares would not meet.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But I have still something to say to you, Mrs. Upton,\" said Mr. Potts; \"I\n",
       "have still to say to you that, much as you have shocked and pained us in\n",
       "the past, you have never so shocked and pained us as now. We had hoped for\n",
       "better things in you,--wider lights, deeper insights, the unsealing of your\n",
       "eyes to error and wrong in yourself; we had hoped that sorrow would work\n",
       "its sacred discipline and that, with your daughter's hand to guide you, you\n",
       "were preparing to follow, from however far a distance, in the footsteps\n",
       "of him who is gone. This must count for us, always, as a dark day of\n",
       "life, when we have seen a human soul turn wilfully from the good held out\n",
       "to it and choose deliberately the evil. I speak for myself and for Mrs.\n",
       "Potts--and in sorrow rather than in wrath, Mrs. Upton. I say nothing of\n",
       "your daughter; I bow my head before that sacred filial grief. I--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But here, suddenly, quiet, swift, irresistible as a flame, Jack rose from\n",
       "his place. It seemed one suave, unbroken motion, that by which he laid a\n",
       "hand on Mr. Potts's shoulder, a hand on Mrs. Potts's shoulder--she had\n",
       "risen in wonder and alarm at the menacing descent upon her lord--laid a\n",
       "hand on each, swept them to the door, opened it, swept them out, and shut\n",
       "the door upon them. Then he turned and leaned upon it, his arms folded.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Perhaps, Jack, you wish to put me out, too,\" said Imogen in a voice of ice\n",
       "and fire. \"Your arguments are conclusive. I hope that mama approves her\n",
       "champion.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie now seemed to lean heavily on the table; she rested her forehead on\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Have you anything to say to me, mama, before Jack executes his justice on\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Have you spared _me_?\" said Imogen. \"Have you spared my father? What right\n",
       "have you to ask for mercy? You are a cruel, a shallow, a selfish woman, and\n",
       "you break my heart as you broke his. Now Jack, you need not put me out. I\n",
       "will go of myself.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "When Jack had closed the door on her, he still stood leaning against it at\n",
       "a distance from Valerie. He saw that she wept, bitterly and uncontrollably;\n",
       "but, at first, awed by her grief, he did not dare approach her. It was only\n",
       "when the sobs were quieted that he went and stood near her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You were right, right,\" he almost whispered.\n",
       "\n",

       "in such rightness.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It had to come,\" said Jack; \"she had to be made to understand. And--you\n",

       "\n",
       "She was not thinking of herself. \"Oh, Jack Jack,\" she spoke at last,\n",

       "\n",
       "Imogen hardly knew where she went, or how, when she left her mother--her\n",
       "mother and Jack--and darted from the house on the wings of a supreme\n",
       "indignation, a supreme despair. Her sense of fitness was not that of Mr.\n",
       "Potts, and she knew that her father's biography was doomed. Against her\n",
       "mother's wish it could not, with any grace, any dignity, be published. Mr.\n",
       "Potts would put forth appreciation of his departed chief in the small,\n",
       "grandiloquent review to which he contributed--he had only delayed because\n",
       "of the greater project--but such a tribute would be a sealing of public\n",
       "failure rather than the kindling of public recognition. Already her father,\n",

       "\n",
       "The word \"forgotten\" seemed like the beat of dark, tragic wings, bearing\n",

       "sense of personal wrong--though that was fierce,--that made her flight so\n",
       "blind and headlong--not her mother's cruelty nor Jack's sinister espousal\n",
       "of the cause he saw as evil; it was this final, this culminating wrong to\n",
       "her father. His face rose before her, while she fled, the deep, dark eyes\n",
       "dwelling with persistence on her as though they asked,--she seemed to hear\n",
       "the very words and in his very voice:--\"What have they done to me, little\n",

       "hands?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "For it was that. Dust, the dust of indifferent time, of cold-hearted\n",
       "oblivion, was drifting over him, hiding his smile, his eyes, his tears.\n",
       "It seemed to mount, to suffocate her, as she ran, this dust, strewn by\n",
       "her mother's hand. Even in her own heart she had known the parching of\n",
       "its drifting fall, known that crouching doubts--not of him, never of\n",
       "him--but of his greatness, had lurked in ambush since her mother had come\n",
       "home;--known that the Pottses and their fitness had never before been so\n",
       "clearly seen for the little that they were since her mother--and all that\n",
       "her mother had brought--had come into her life. And, before this drifting\n",
       "of dust upon her faith in her father's greatness, her heart, all that was\n",
       "deepest in it, broke into a greater trust, a greater love, sobs beneath it.\n",
       "He was not great, perhaps, as the world counted greatness; but he was good,\n",
       "good,--he was sorrowful and patient. He loved her as no one had ever loved\n",
       "her. His ideals were hers and her love was his. Dust might lie on his tomb;\n",
       "but never, never, in her heart.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, it's cruel! cruel! cruel!\" she panted, as she ran, ran, up the rocky,\n",
       "woodland path, leaping from ledge to ledge, slipping on the silky moss,\n",
       "falling now and then on hands and knees, but not pausing or faltering until\n",
       "she reached the murmuring pine-woods, the grassy, aromatic glades where the\n",
       "mountain-laurel grew.\n",
       "\n",
       "Pallid, disheveled, with tragic, unseeing eyes and parted lips--the\n",
       "hollowed eyes, the sorrowful lips of a classic mask--she rushed from the\n",
       "shadows of the mountain--path into this place of sunlight and solitude. A\n",
       "doomed, distraught Antigone.\n",
       "\n",
       "And so she looked to Sir Basil, who, his back against a warm rock, a\n",
       "cigarette in one lazy hand, was outstretched there before her on the moss,\n",
       "a bush of flowering laurel at his head, and, at his feet, beyond tree-tops,\n",
       "the steep, far blue of the lower world. He was gazing placidly at this\n",
       "view, empty of thought and even of conscious appreciation, wrapped in a\n",
       "balmy contentment, when, with the long, deep breath of a hunted deer,\n",
       "Imogen leaped from darkness into light, and her face announced such\n",
       "disaster that, casting aside the cigarette, springing to his feet, he\n",
       "seized her by the arms, thinking that she might fall before him. And\n",
       "indeed she would have cast herself face downward on the grass had he not\n",
       "been there; and she leaned forward on his supporting hands, speechless,\n",
       "breathing heavily, borne down by the impetus of her headlong run. Then, her\n",
       "face hidden from him as she leaned, she burst into sobs.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Upton!--Imogen!--My dear child!--\" said Sir Basil, in a crescendo of\n",
       "distress and solicitude.\n",
       "\n",
       "She leaned there on his hands weeping so bitterly and so helplessly that he\n",
       "finished his phrase by putting an arm around her, and so more effectually\n",
       "supporting her, so satisfying, also, his own desire to comfort and caress\n",
       "her.\n",
       "\n",
       "The human touch, the human tenderness--though him she hardly realized--drew\n",
       "her grief to articulateness. \"Oh--my father!--my father!--Oh--what have\n",
       "they done to you!\" she gasped, leaning her forehead against Sir Basil's\n",
       "shoulder.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Your father?\" Sir Basil repeated soothingly, since this departed\n",
       "personality seemed a menace that might easily be dealt with, \"What is it?\n",
       "What have they done? How can I help you? My dear child, do treat me as a\n",
       "friend. Do tell me what is the matter.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It's mama! mama!--she has broken my heart--as she broke his,\" sobbed\n",
       "Imogen, finding her former words. Already, such was the amazing irony of\n",
       "events, Sir Basil seemed, more than anyone in the world, to take that\n",
       "dead father's place, to help her in her grief over him. The puzzle of it\n",
       "inflicted a deeper pang. \"I can't tell you,\" she sobbed. \"But I can never,\n",
       "never forgive her!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Forgive your mother?\" Sir Basil repeated, shocked. \"Don't, I beg of you,\n",
       "speak so. It's some misunderstanding.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No!--No!--It is understanding--it is the whole understanding! It has come\n",
       "out at last--the truth--the dreadful truth.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But can't you tell me? can't you explain?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She lifted her face and drew away from him as she said, pressing her\n",
       "handkerchief to her eyes: \"You never knew him. You cannot care for him--no\n",
       "one who cares, as much as you do, for her,--can ever care for him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Basil had deeply flushed. He led her to the sunny rock and made her\n",
       "sit down on a low ledge, where she leaned forward, her face in her hands,\n",
       "long sighs of exhaustion succeeding her tears. \"I know nothing about your\n",
       "father, as you say, and I do care, very much, for your mother,\" said Sir\n",
       "Basil after a little while. \"But I care for you, very much, too.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, but you could never care for me so much as to think her wrong.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I don't know about that. Why not?--if she is wrong. One often thinks\n",
       "people one is fond of very wrong. Do you know,\" and Sir Basil now sat down\n",
       "beside her, a little lower, on the moss, \"do you know you'll make me quite\n",
       "wretched if you won't have confidence in me. I really can't stand seeing\n",
       "you suffer and not know what it's about. I don't--I can't feel myself such\n",
       "a stranger as that. Won't you think of me,\" he took one of her hands and\n",
       "held it as he said this, \"won't you think of me as, well, as a sort of\n",
       "affectionate old brother, you know? I want to be trusted, and to see if I\n",
       "can't help you. Don't be afraid,\" he added, \"of being disloyal--of making\n",
       "me care less, you know, for your mother, by anything you say; for you\n",
       "wouldn't.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Leaning there, her face hidden, while she half heard him, it struck her\n",
       "suddenly, a shaft of light in darkness, that, indeed, he might help her.\n",
       "She dropped her hand to look at him and, with all its tear-stained\n",
       "disfigurement, he thought that he had never seen anything more heavenly\n",
       "than that look. It sought, it sounded him, pleaded with and caressed him.\n",
       "And, with all its solemnity, there dawned in it a tenderness deeper than\n",
       "any that he had ever seen in her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I do trust you,\" she said. \"I think of you as a near, a dear friend. And,\n",
       "since you promise me that it will change you in nothing, I will tell you. I\n",
       "believe that perhaps you can help us,--my father and me. You must count me\n",
       "with him, you know, always. We want to write a life of him, Mr. Potts and\n",
       "I. Mr. Potts--you may have seen it--is an ordinary person, ordinary but\n",
       "for one thing, one great and beautiful thing that papa and I always felt\n",
       "in him,--and that beautiful thing is his depth of unselfish devotion to\n",
       "great causes and to good people. He worked for my father like a faithful,\n",
       "loving dog. He had an accurate knowledge of all the activities that papa's\n",
       "life was given to--all the ideals it aimed at and attained--yes, yes,\n",
       "attained,--whatever they may say. He has a very skilful pen, and is in\n",
       "touch with the public press. So, though I would, of course, have wished for\n",
       "a more adequate biographer, I was glad and proud to accept his offer; and I\n",
       "would have overlooked, revised, everything. We felt,--and by we, I mean not\n",
       "only Mr. and Mrs. Potts, but all his many, many friends, all those whose\n",
       "lives he loved and helped and lifted--that we owed it to the world he\n",
       "served not to let his name fade from among us. You cannot dream, Sir Basil,\n",
       "of what sort of man my father was. His life was one long devotion to the\n",
       "highest things, one long service of the weak and oppressed, one long battle\n",
       "with the wrong. Those who are incapable of following him to the heights can\n",
       "give you no true picture of him. I will say nothing, in this respect, of\n",
       "mama, except that she could not follow him,--and that she made him very,\n",
       "very unhappy, and with him, me. For I shared all his griefs. She left us;\n",
       "she laughed at all the things we cared and worked for. My father never\n",
       "spoke bitterly of her; his last words, almost, were for her, words of\n",
       "tenderness and pity and forgiveness. He had the capacity that only great\n",
       "souls have, of love for littler natures. I say this much so that you may\n",
       "know that any idea that you may have gathered of my father is, perforce, a\n",
       "garbled, a false one. He was a noble, a wonderful man. Everything I am I\n",
       "owe to him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen had straightened herself, the traces of weeping almost gone, her own\n",

       "and her father's wrongs, thus objectivized in careful phrases, made\n",
       "indignation at once colder and deeper. Her very effort to quell\n",
       "indignation, to command her voice to an even justice of tone before this\n",
       "lover of her mother's, gave it a resonant quality, curiously impressive.\n",
       "And, as she looked before her, down into the blue profundities, the sense\n",
       "of her own sincerity seemed to pulse back to her from her silent listener,\n",
       "and filled her with a growing consciousness of power over him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"This morning,\" she took up her theme on that resonant note, deepened to a\n",
       "tragic pitch, \"we went to mama--Mr. Potts and I--to tell her of our project\n",
       "of commemoration, to ask her coöperation. We wanted to be very generous\n",

       "our work without consulting her. She received us with cold indifference.\n",
       "She tried not to listen, when she heard what our errand was. And her\n",
       "indifference became hostility, when she understood. All her old hatred for\n",
       "what he was and meant, all her fundamental antagonism to the purpose of his\n",
       "life--and to him--came at last, openly, to the light. She was forced to\n",
       "reveal herself. Not only has she no love, no reverence for him, but she\n",
       "cannot bear that others should learn to love him and to reverence him.\n",
       "She sneered at his claim to distinction; she refused her consent to our\n",
       "project. It is a terrible thing for me to say--but I must--and you will\n",
       "understand me--you who will not care less for her because she is so\n",
       "wrong--what I feel most of all in her attitude is a childish, yet a cruel,\n",

       "in the wrong will all her life be proved;--it is that that she will not\n",
       "hear of. She _wants_ him to be obscure, undistinguished, negligible,\n",
       "because it's that that she has always thought him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Basil, while she spoke, had kept his eyes fixed on the hand he\n",
       "held, a beautiful hand, white, curiously narrow, with pointed, upturned\n",
       "finger-tips. Once or twice a dull color rose to his sunburned cheek, but in\n",
       "his well-balanced mind was a steady perception of what the filial grief and\n",
       "pain must be from which certain words came. He could not resent them; it\n",
       "was inevitable that a child who had so loved her father should so think and\n",
       "feel. And her self-control, her accurate fluency, answered with him for her\n",
       "sincerity as emotion could not have done. Passion would never carry this\n",
       "noble girl into overstatement. Fairness constrained him to admit, while he\n",
       "listened, that dark color in his cheek, that her view of her father was\n",
       "more likely to be right than her mother's view. An unhappily married woman\n",
       "was seldom fair. Mrs. Upton had never mentioned her husband to him, never\n",
       "alluded to him except in most formal terms; but the facts of her flight\n",
       "from the marital hearth, the fact that he had made her so unhappy, had been\n",
       "to him sufficient evidence of Mr. Upton's general unworthiness. Now, though\n",
       "Imogen's tragic ardor did not communicate any of her faith in her father's\n",
       "wonder or nobility, it did convince him of past unfairness toward, no\n",

       "\n",
       "So, when Imogen had finished, though he sat silent for a little while,\n",
       "though beneath the steady survey of what she put before him was a stirring\n",
       "of trouble, it was in a tone of quiet acceptance that he at last said,\n",
       "looking up at her, \"Yes; I quite see what you feel about it. To you, of\n",
       "course, they must look like that, your mother's reasons. They must look\n",
       "very differently to her, that goes without saying. We can't really make out\n",
       "these things, you know, these fundamental antagonisms; I never knew it went\n",
       "as far as that. But I quite see. Poor child. I'm very sorry. It is most\n",
       "awfully hard on you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Don't think of me!\" Imogen breathed out on a note of pain. \"It's not of\n",
       "myself I'm thinking, not of my humiliation and despair--but of him!--of\n",
       "him!--Is it _right_ that I should submit? _Ought_ a project like ours to be\n",
       "abandoned for such a reason?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Again Sir Basil was silent for some moments, considering the narrow white\n",
       "hands. \"Perhaps she'll come round,--think better of it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah!--\" it was now on a note of deep, of tremulous hope that she breathed\n",
       "it out, looking into his eyes with the profound, searching look so moving\n",
       "to him; \"Ah!--it's there, it's there, that you could help me. She would\n",
       "never yield to me. She might to you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, I don't think that likely,\" Sir Basil protested, the flush darkening.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, yes,\" said Imogen, leaning toward him above his clasp of her hand.\n",
       "\"Yes, if anything is likely that is so. If hope is anywhere, it's there.\n",
       "Don't you see, in her eyes I stand for _him_. To yield to me would be like\n",
       "yielding to him, would be his triumph. That's what she can't forgive in\n",
       "me--that I do stand for him, that I live by all that she rejected. She\n",
       "would never yield to me,--but she might yield _for_ you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Shall I speak to her about it?\" Sir Basil asked abruptly, after another\n",
       "moment in which Imogen's hand grasped his tightly, its soft, warm fingers\n",
       "more potent in appeal than even her eyes had been. And now, again,\n",
       "she leaned toward him, her eyes inundating him with radiant trust and\n",
       "gratitude, her hands drawing his hand to her breast and holding it there,\n",
       "so clasped.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Will you?--Oh, will you?--dear Sir Basil.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Basil stammered a little. \"I'll have a try--It's hard on you, I think.\n",
       "I don't see why you shouldn't have your heart's desire. It's an awfully\n",
       "queer thing to do,--but, for your sake, I'll have a try--put it to her, you\n",
       "know.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah, I _knew_ that you were big,\" said Imogen.\n",
       "\n",
       "He looked at her, his hand between her hands. The flowering laurel was\n",
       "behind her head. The pine-forest murmured about them. The sky was blue\n",
       "above them, and the deep blue of the distance lay at their feet. Suddenly,\n",
       "as they looked into each other's eyes, it dawned in the consciousness of\n",
       "both that something was happening.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was to Sir Basil that it was happening. Imogen's was but the\n",
       "consciousness of his experience. Such a thing could hardly happen to\n",
       "Imogen. Neither her senses, nor her emotions, nor her imagination played\n",
       "any dominant part in her nature. She was incapable of falling in love in\n",
       "the helpless, headlong, human fashion that the term implies. But though\n",
       "such feeling lacked, the perception of it in others was swift, and while\n",
       "she leaned to Sir Basil in the sunlight, while she clasped his hand to her\n",
       "breast, while their eyes dwelt deeply on each other, she seemed to hear,\n",
       "like a rising chime of wonder and delight, the ringing of herald bells that\n",
       "sang: \"Mine--mine--mine--if I choose to take him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Wonderful indeed it was to feel this influx of certain power. Sunlight,\n",
       "like that about them, seemed to rise, slowly, softly, within her, like the\n",
       "upwelling of a spring of joy.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was happening, it had happened to him, his eyes told her that; but\n",
       "whether he knew as she did she doubted and, for the beautiful moment, it\n",
       "added a last touch of charm to her exultation to know that, while she was\n",
       "sure, she could leave that light veil of his wonder shimmering between\n",
       "them.\n",
       "\n",
       "With the vision of the unveiling her mind leaped to the thought of her\n",
       "mother and of Jack, and with that thought came a swift pulse of vengeful\n",
       "gladness. So she would make answer to them both--the scorner--the rejector.\n",
       "Not for a moment must she listen to the voices of petty doubts and pities.\n",
       "This love, that lay like a bauble in her mother's hand--an unfit ornament\n",
       "for her years--would shine on her own head like a diadem. Unasked,\n",
       "undreamed of, it had turned to her; it was her highest duty to keep and\n",
       "wear it. It was far, far more than her duty to herself; it was her duty to\n",
       "this man, finished, mature, yet full of unawakened possibility; it was her\n",
       "duty to that large, vague world that his life touched, a world where her\n",
       "young faiths and vigors would bring a light such as her mother's gay little\n",
       "taper could never spread. These thoughts, and others, flashed through\n",
       "Imogen's mind, with the swiftness and exactitude of a drowning vision. Yet,\n",
       "after the long moment of vivid realization, it was at its height that a\n",
       "qualm, a sinking overtook her. The gift had come; of that she was sure. But\n",
       "its triumphant displayal might be delayed--nay, might be jeopardized. Some\n",
       "perverse loyalty in his nature, some terrified decisiveness of action on\n",
       "her mother's part, and the golden reality might even be made to crumble.\n",
       "For one moment, as the qualm seized her, she saw herself--and the thought\n",
       "was like a flying flame that scorched her lips as it passed--she saw\n",
       "herself sweeping aside the veil, sinking upon his breast, with tears that\n",
       "would reveal him to himself and her to him.\n",
       "\n",
       "But it was impossible for Imogen to yield open-eyed to temptation that\n",
       "could not be sanctified. Her strong sense of personal dignity held her from\n",
       "the impulse, and a quick recognition, too, that it might lower her starry\n",
       "altitude in his eyes. She must stand still, stand perfectly still, and he\n",
       "would come to her. She could protect him from her mother's clinging--this\n",
       "she recognized as a strange yet an insistent duty--but between him and her\n",
       "there must not be a shadow, an ambiguity.\n",
       "\n",
       "The radiance of the renunciation, the resolve, was in her face as she\n",
       "gently released his hand, gently rose, standing smiling, with a strange,\n",
       "rapt smile, above him.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Basil rose, too, silent, and looking hard at her. She guessed at the\n",
       "turmoil, the wonder of his honest soul, his fear lest she did guess it,\n",
       "and, with the fear, the irrepressible hope that, in some sense, it was\n",
       "echoed.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"My dear, dear friend,\" she said, putting her hand on his shoulder,\n",

       "to heal everything,--to glorify everything,--to promise everything?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He looked up at the sky, still speechless. Her face, her smile--the sky\n",

       "thing claims one suddenly, must not the lesser things inevitably go?--Could\n",
       "one hold them?--Ought one to try to hold them? There was tumult in poor Sir\n",

       "\n",
       "But when everything culminated in the longing to seize this heavenly\n",
       "child--this heavenly woman--to seize and kiss her--a sturdy sense of\n",
       "honesty warned him that not so could he, with honor, go forward. He must\n",

       "\n",

       "She herself had still too strongly upon her the qualm of imminent shipwreck\n",

       "just how threatening the horizon loomed, should lack the appetite that his\n",
       "reassuring presence evoked. Jack noticed that she ate nothing, but he alone\n",

       "\n",
       "It was perhaps Jack who noticed most universally at that wonderful little\n",

       "diffused circle of radiance and the windows, with their faintly stirring\n",
       "muslin curtains, to open on a warm, mysterious ocean of darkness. The\n",

       "If one wanted pure amusement, with but the faintest tincture of pity to\n",

       "their silence was not for one moment allowed to become awkward, to\n",
       "themselves, or to others, Jack recognized as one of Valerie's miracles that\n",
       "night, and when he considered that the Pottses might not guess to whom they\n",
       "owed their ease, he could hardly pity them. That their eyes should not meet\n",
       "his, except for a heavy stare or two, was natural. After this meeting in\n",
       "the mirage-like oasis that Valerie made bloom for them all, he knew that\n",
       "for the Pottses he would be relegated to the sightless, soundless Saharas\n",
       "of a burning remembrance. It was but a small part of his attention that was\n",
       "spared to the consciousness that Mr. Potts was very uplifted, that Mrs.\n",
       "Potts was very tense, and that Mrs. Potts's dress, as if in protest against\n",
       "any form of relaxation and condonation, was very, very high and tight.\n",
       "Indeed, Mrs. Potts, in her room, before the descent, had said to her\n",
       "husband, in the mutual tones of their great situation, laying aside with\n",
       "resolution the half-high bodice that, till then, had marked her concession\n",
       "to fashionable standards, \"Never, never again, in her house. Let her bare\n",
       "her bosom if she will. I shall protest against her by every symbol.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Potts, with somber justice, as though he exonerated an Agrippina from\n",

       "it, had been slightly veiled; but:--\"I understand those tuckers,\" Mrs.\n",

       "\n",
       "But, though Jack saw all this, he was not in the humor for more than a\n",
       "superficial sense of amusement. With his excited sense of mirth was a\n",
       "deeper sense of disaster, and the poor Pottses were at once too grotesque\n",
       "and too insignificant to satisfy it.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was upon Imogen and Sir Basil that his eye most frequently turned.\n",

       "Mr. Potts and Valerie, and Jack, Mrs. Wake and Mrs. Potts brought the\n",
       "circle round to Sir Basil, a neat gradation of affinities.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack, in a glance, had seen that Imogen had been passionately weeping; he\n",

       "he knew that his heart was hardened. Never, judged from a dispassionate\n",
       "standard, had Imogen been so right, and her rightness left him indifferent.\n",
       "If she had been wrong; if she had been, in some sense guilty, if her\n",
       "consciousness had not been so supremely spotless, he would have been\n",
       "sorrier for her. It was the woman beside him whose motives he could not\n",
       "penetrate, whose action to-day had seemed to him mistaken, it was for her\n",

       "\n",
       "Sir Basil was evidently as bent on helping her as was her mother. He talked\n",
       "very gaily, tossing back all Valerie's balls. He rallied Miss Bocock on\n",
       "her radical tendencies, and engaged in a humorous dispute with Mrs. Wake\n",
       "in defense of racing. Imogen, when he spoke, turned her eyes on him and\n",
       "listened gravely. When her mother spoke, she looked down at her plate. But\n",
       "once or twice Jack caught her eye, while her mother's attention was engaged\n",
       "elsewhere, resting upon her with a curious, a piercing intentness. Such a\n",
       "cold glitter, as of steel, was in the glance, that, instinctively, his own\n",
       "turned on Valerie, as if he had felt her threatened.\n",
       "\n",
       "This instinct of protection was oddly on the watch to-night. Under\n",

       "inarticulate sorrow, greater than the apparent causes warranted, that\n",
       "mourned with and for her. In the illumination of this intuition Valerie, he\n",
       "thought, had never been so lovely as to-night. It seemed to him that her\n",
       "body, with its indolence of aspect, expressed an almost superhuman courage.\n",
       "She was soft and fragile and weary, leaning there in her transparent black,\n",
       "her cheek in her hand, her elbow, in, its loose sleeve, resting on the\n",
       "table; but she made him think of a reed: that the tempest could not break.\n",
       "\n",
       "Her face was pale, he had never seen it so drained of its dusky rose. There\n",
       "was something inexpressibly touching in the flicker of her smile on the\n",
       "white, white cheek, in the innocent gaiety of the dimple placed high and\n",
       "recalling Japanese suggestions, vague as the scent of sandal-wood. She,\n",
       "too, had wept, as he well knew; and his heart ached, dully, as he thought\n",
       "of that bitter weeping, those tears, of humility and pain. Her eyelids,\n",
       "strangely discolored, were like the petals of a melancholy flower, and her\n",
       "eyes were heavy and gentle.\n",
       "\n",
       "A vague, absurdly alarming sense of presage grew upon him as his eyes went\n",
       "from this face to Imogen's--so still, so cold, so unanswering, lightened,\n",
       "as if from a vail of heavy cloud, by that stealthy, baleful, illuminating\n",
       "glance. In Imogen's whole bearing he read renouncement, but renouncement,\n",
       "in her hand, would assuredly prove a scourge for her mother's shoulders.\n",
       "For the time that they must be together, she and her mother, her sense of\n",

       "only solution, the only salvation. At the thought of it, that one solution,\n",
       "his heart ached more sharply, but it ached for himself alone. For she must\n",
       "go away; yes, that was the only escape; she must go away at once, with Sir\n",

       "illuminating of all--as he plunged--that in the results of action he would\n",
       "find his test. If she cared for him--really cared--she would grant his\n",

       "very deep acquiescence in his own nature, would keep him beside her, and\n",
       "to-night would see them as affianced lovers. It would be a pity to have let\n",
       "one's new-found soul go; but, after all, it was so very new that the pang\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I don't believe that you could understand, ever,\" she said at last in an\n",

       "She loved his manliness and his childishness. As she had guarded the other,\n",
       "once loved, man from revealment she would have guarded this one from ironic\n",

       "to her. He could never see as she saw and her fidelity to her own light\n",
       "could in his eyes be but perversity. Besides, she could guess at the\n",

       "bereaved of her father, of her lover, desolate, amazed, rose before her\n",
       "and, behind it, the hovering, retributory gaze of her husband.\n",

       "\n",
       "With this background of interpretation it was, therefore, with a growing\n",

       "decisively than even before. Verbal definiteness left hazes of possibility\n",
       "compared to this dreadfully competent reticence. It was more than evasion,\n",
       "more than reticence, more than abdication that she felt in Jack; it was a\n",
       "deep hostility, it was the steady burning of that flame that she had seen\n",
       "in his eye that morning when she had told her mother that she was cruel\n",

       "upon vengeance. Everything was stripped from her, if--if Jack and her\n",
       "mother had succeeded. With lightning-like rapidity her mind grasped its\n",
       "suspicion. She looked back at Jack. His eyes, too, were fixed on the\n",
       "veranda, and suspicion was struck to certainty by what she read in them. He\n",
       "was tense; he was white; he was triumphant. Too soon triumphant! In another\n",
       "moment the imminence of her terror passed by. The clasp was not that of a\n",
       "plighting. It was over; it denoted some lesser compact, one that meant,\n",

       "\n",
       "Imogen paused but for a moment to draw the breath of a mingled relief\n",
       "and realization. Her knowledge was the only weapon left in her hand, and\n",
       "strength, safety, the mere semblance of dignity, lay in its concealment. If\n",

       "nothing really desperate yet. But, during the rest of the afternoon, while\n",
       "they made tea, spread viands, sat about on the moss and rocks laughing,\n",
       "talking, eating, the sense of risk did not leave her. Nothing was lost,\n",
       "yet, but it was just possible that what she had, in her folly, expected to\n",
       "happen the other night to her and Jack, might really happen to Sir Basil\n",
       "and her mother; in the extremity of alienation they might find the depths\n",
       "of need. He thought her wrong, but he also thought her charming.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sitting a little above them all, on a higher rock, watching them while\n",
       "seeming not to watch, she felt that her sense of peril strangely isolated\n",
       "her from the thoughtless group. She could guess at nothing from her\n",
       "mother's face. She had not spoken with her mother since the day of\n",
       "the disaster--and of the dawn. It was probable that, like her own sad\n",
       "benignity, her mother's placidity was nothing but a veil, but she could not\n",
       "believe that it veiled a sense of peril. Under her white straw hat, with\n",
       "broad black ribbons tying beneath the chin, it was very pale--but that was\n",
       "usual of late--and very worn, too, as it should be; but it was more full\n",
       "of charm than it had any right to be. Her mother--oh! despite pallor and\n",
       "fading--was a woman to be loved; and that she believed herself a woman\n",
       "loved, Imogen, with a deep stirring of indignation and antagonism,\n",
       "suspected. Yes, she counted upon Sir Basil, of that Imogen was sure,\n",
       "but what she couldn't make out was whether her mother guessed that her\n",
       "confidence was threatened. Did she at all see where Sir Basil's heart had\n",
       "turned, as Jack had seen? Was her mother, too, capable of Jack's maneuvers?\n",
       "\n",
       "From her mother she looked at Sir Basil, looked with eyes marvelously\n",
       "serene. He lounged delightfully. His clothes were delightfully right; they\n",
       "seemed as much a part of his personality as the cones were of the pines,\n",
       "the ferns of the long glades. Rightness--exquisite, unconscious rightness,\n",
       "was what he expressed. Not the rightness of warfare and effort that Imogen\n",
       "believed in and stood for, but a rightness that had come to him as a gift,\n",
       "not as a conquest, just as the cones had come to the pine-trees. The way\n",
       "he tilted his Panama hat over his eyes so that only his chin and crisply\n",
       "twisted mustache were unshadowed, the way in which he held his cigarette in\n",
       "a hand so brown that the gold of the seal ring upon it looked pale, even\n",
       "the way in which he wagged, now and then, his foot in its shapely tan\n",
       "shoe,--were all as delightful as his limpid smile up at her mother, as his\n",
       "voice, deep, decisive, and limpid, too.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen was not aware of these appreciations in herself as she watched him\n",
       "with that serene covertness, not at all aware that her senses were lending\n",
       "her a hand in her struggle for possession and ascendancy, and giving to\n",
       "her hold on the new and threatened belonging a peculiar tenacity. But she\n",
       "did tell herself, again and again, with pride and pain, that this at last\n",
       "was love, a love that justified anything, and that cast all lesser things\n",
       "aside. And, with this thought of rejection, Imogen found her eyes turning\n",
       "to Jack. She looked at Jack as serenely as she had at Sir Basil, and at him\n",
       "she could trust herself to look more fixedly.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack's rightnesses were not a bit like those of nature. He was hesitant,\n",
       "unfinished, beside Sir Basil. His voice was meager, his form was meager,\n",
       "his very glance lacked the full, untroubled assurance of the other's. As\n",
       "for his clothes, with a sly little pleasure Imogen noted, point by point,\n",
       "how they just missed easy perfection. Very certainly this man who had\n",
       "failed her was a trophy not comparable to the man who now cared. She\n",
       "told herself that very often, emphasizing the unfavorable contrast. For,\n",
       "strangely enough, it was now, at the full distance of her separation\n",
       "from Jack, an irrevocable separation, that she needed the support of\n",
       "such emphasis. In Jack's absent stare at the lake, his nervous features\n",
       "composed to momentary unconsciousness, she could but feel a quality that,\n",
       "helplessly, she must appreciate. There was in the young man's face a\n",
       "purity, a bravery, a capacity of subtle spiritual choice that made it,\n",
       "essentially, one of the most civilized she had ever known. Sir Basil's\n",
       "brain, if it came to comparison, lacked one or two convolutions that Jack's\n",
       "undoubtedly possessed.\n",
       "\n",
       "And, appreciating the lost lover, as, through her own sharpness of\n",
       "intelligence she was bound to do, poor Imogen knew again the twisted pang\n",
       "of divided desire. Was it the higher that she had lost, or the higher\n",
       "that she so strangely struggled for? Her eyes, turning again on Sir\n",
       "Basil, stayed themselves on the assurances of his charm, his ease,\n",
       "his rightnesses; but the worst bitterness of all lurked under these\n",
       "consolations; for, though one was lost, the other was not securely gained.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen, that night, made another dash for the open, only, again, to be\n",
       "foiled. Her mother and Miss Bocock were safely on the veranda in the\n",
       "moonlight, the others safely talking in the drawing-room; Sir Basil, only,\n",
       "was not to be seen, and Imogen presently detected the spark of his cigar\n",
       "wandering among the flower-borders. She could venture on boldness, though\n",
       "she skirted about the house to join him. What if Jack did see them\n",
       "together? It was only natural that, if she were unconscious, she should now\n",
       "and then seek out her paternal friend. But hardly had she emerged from the\n",
       "shadow of the house, hardly had Sir Basil become aware of her approach,\n",
       "when, with laughter and chattering outcries the whole intolerable horde\n",
       "was upon her. It was Rose who voiced the associated proposal, a moonlight\n",
       "ramble; it was Rose who seized upon Sir Basil with her hateful air of\n",
       "indifferent yet assured coquetry; but Imogen guessed that she was a tool,\n",
       "even if an ignorant one, in the hands of Jack. Miss Bocock and her mother\n",
       "had not joined them and, in a last desperate hope, Imogen said,--\"Mama,\n",
       "too, and Miss Bocock,--we mustn't leave them. Sir Basil, won't you go and\n",
       "fetch them?\" And then, Sir Basil detached from Rose, on his way, she\n",
       "murmured,--\"I must see that she doesn't forget her shawl,\" and darted after\n",
       "him. Once more get him to herself and, in the obscurity of the woods, they\n",
       "might elude the others yet. But, as they approached the veranda, she found\n",
       "that Jack was beside them.\n",
       "\n",
       "Neither Valerie nor Miss Bocock cared to join the expedition; and Valerie,\n",
       "cryptically, for her daughter's understanding, said: \"Do you really want\n",
       "more scenery, Sir Basil? You and Imogen had much better keep us company\n",
       "here. We have earned a lazy evening.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, no, but Rose has claimed Sir Basil as her cavalier,\" Jack,\n",
       "astonishingly, cut in. \"It's all her idea, so that she could have a talk\n",
       "with him. Do you come, too,\" Jack urged. \"It's only a little walk and the\n",
       "moonlight is wonderful among the woods.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Upton's eye rested fixedly upon him for a moment. Imogen saw that, but\n",
       "could not know whether her mother shared her own astonishment for Jack's\n",
       "development or whether the look were of the nature of an interchange. She\n",
       "shook her head, however.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, thanks, I am too tired. Be sure and show Sir Basil the view from the\n",
       "rustic seat, Imogen. And, oh, Imogen, do you and Sir Basil go to the pantry\n",
       "and ask Selma for some cakes. You will like something to eat.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I'll come, too,\" said Jack cheerfully. \"I must get my stick.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "And thus it was that Sir Basil remained standing beside Mrs. Upton, while\n",
       "the young couple, in absolute silence, accomplished their mission.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen only wondered, as they went, side by side, swiftly, round to the\n",
       "pantry, if Jack did not hear the deep, indignant breaths she vainly\n",
       "tried to master. The rest of the evening repeated the indignities of the\n",
       "afternoon. She was watched, guarded, baffled. Proudly she relinquished\n",
       "every attempt to checkmate; and her mother was not there; for the moment\n",
       "there was no anxiety on that score. But the sense of deep breathing did not\n",
       "leave her. What _wouldn't_ Jack do? She was quite sure that he would lie,\n",
       "if, technically, he had not lied already. The stick had been in the hall\n",
       "near the pantry. If it hadn't;--well, with her consciousness of whistling\n",
       "speed, of a neck-to-neck race, she really would not have had time for a\n",
       "pause of wonder and condemnation.\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "XXV\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "She woke next morning to that fierce consciousness of a race. And the goal\n",
       "must now be near, defeat or victory imminent.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was early and she dressed quickly. She couldn't boldly rap at Sir\n",
       "Basil's door and call him to join her in the garden for a dewy walk before\n",
       "breakfast, for Jack's was the room next his; but, outside, as she drifted\n",
       "back and forth over the lawn, in full view of his window, she sang to\n",
       "herself, so that he could hear, sang sweetly, loudly, sadly, a strain of\n",
       "Wagner. It happened, indeed, to be the Pilgrim's March from Tannhäuser that\n",
       "she fixed upon for her _aubade_. Jack would never suspect such singing, and\n",
       "Sir Basil must surely seize its opportunity. But he did not appear. She\n",
       "surmised that he was not yet up and that it might be wiser to wait for him\n",
       "in the dining-room.\n",
       "\n",
       "As she crossed the veranda she heard voices around the corner, a snatch of\n",
       "talk from two other early risers sitting outside the drawing-room windows.\n",
       "Mary and Rose; she placed them, as she paused.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But Jack himself often talks in just that way,\" Mary was saying, pained it\n",
       "was evident, and puzzled, too, by some imputation, that she hadn't been\n",
       "able to deny.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, dear old Jack,\" Rose rejoined; \"he does talk in a very tiresome way\n",
       "sometimes; so do you, Mary my darling;--you are all tarred with the same\n",
       "solemn brush; but, you see, it's just that; one may talk like a prig and\n",
       "yet not be one. Jack, behind the big words, means them all, is them all,\n",
       "really. Whereas Imogen;--why she's little--little--little. Even Jack has\n",
       "found that out at last.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Rose! Rose! Don't--It's not true. I can't believe it! I won't believe it!\"\n",
       "broke from Mary. Her chair was pushed back impetuously, and Imogen darted\n",
       "into the dining-room and from there into the hall to find herself, at last,\n",
       "face to face with Sir Basil.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I hoped I'd find you. I heard you singing in the garden. What is that\n",
       "thing,--Gounod, isn't it? Do let's have a turn in the garden.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "But even as he said it, holding her hand, the fatal chink of the\n",
       "approaching breakfast tray told them that the opportunity had come too\n",
       "late. Rose and Mary already were greeting them, Jack and Miss Bocock called\n",
       "morning wishes from above.\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie was a late riser; and Imogen, behind the tea-pot and coffee,\n",
       "was always conscious of offering a crisp and charming contrast to lax\n",
       "self-indulgence. But this morning, as they all hemmed her in, fixed her\n",
       "in her rightful place, her cheeks irrepressibly burned with vexation and\n",
       "disappointment. The overheard insolence, too, had been like a sudden slap.\n",
       "She mastered herself sufficiently to kiss Mary's cheek and to take Rose's\n",
       "hand with a gaze of pure unconsciousness, a gaze that should have been as a\n",
       "coal of fire laid upon her venomous head.\n",
       "\n",
       "But Rose showed no symptom of scorching. She trailed to her place, in a\n",
       "morning-gown all lace and ribbons, smiling nonchalantly at Jack and saucily\n",
       "at Sir Basil, with whom she had established relations of chaffing coquetry;\n",
       "she told Imogen to remember that she liked her coffee half-and-half with a\n",
       "lot of cream and three lumps of sugar. She looked as guiltless as poor Mary\n",
       "looked guilty.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Eddy's late as usual, I suppose,\" she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He inherits laziness from mama,\" Imogen smiled, putting in four lumps, a\n",
       "trivial vengeance she could not resist.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Some of her charms he has inherited, it's true.\" Rose, in the absence of\n",
       "her worshiped hostess gave herself extreme license in guileless prods and\n",
       "thrusts. \"I only wish he had inherited more. Here you are, Eddy, after\n",
       "all, falsifying my hopes of you. We are talking about your hereditary good\n",
       "points, Eddy;--in what others, except morning laziness, do you resemble\n",
       "your mother?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, I hate strings of milk in my coffee,\" said Eddy, bending over his\n",
       "sister to put a perfunctory kiss upon her brow, \"and as I observe one in\n",
       "that cup I hope it's not intended for me. Imogen, why won't you use the\n",
       "strainer?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "With admirable patience, as if humoring two spoiled children, Imogen filled\n",
       "another cup with greater care.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mama feels just as I do about strings in coffee,\" said Eddy, bearing away\n",
       "his cup. \"We are both of us very highly organized.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You mustn't be over-sensitive, you know,\" said Imogen, \"else you will\n",
       "unfit yourself for life. There are so many strings in one's coffee in\n",
       "life.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The fit avoid them,\" said Eddy, \"as I do.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You inherit that, too, from mama,\" said Imogen, \"the avoidance of\n",
       "difficulties. Do try some of our pop-overs, Miss Bocock; it's a national\n",
       "dish.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What are you going to do this morning, Imogen?\" Jack asked, and she felt\n",
       "that his eye braved hers. \"It's your Girls' Club morning, isn't it? That\n",
       "will do beautifully for you, Miss Bocock. I've been telling Miss Bocock\n",
       "about it; she is very much interested.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Very much indeed. I am on the committee of such a club in England,\" said\n",
       "Miss Bocock; \"I should like to go over it with you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen smiled assent, while inwardly she muttered \"Snake!\" Her morning,\n",
       "already, was done for, unless, indeed, she could annex Sir Basil as a third\n",
       "to the party and, with him, evade Miss Bocock for a few brief moments. But\n",
       "brief moments could do nothing for them. They needed long sunny or moonlit\n",
       "solitudes.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We must be alone together, under the stars, for our souls to _see_,\"\n",
       "Imogen said to herself, while she poured the coffee, while she met Jack's\n",
       "eye, while, beneath this highest thought, the lesser comment of \"Snake!\"\n",
       "made itself heard.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What's become of that interesting girl who had the rival club, Imogen?\"\n",
       "Rose asked. \"The one you squashed.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"We make her very welcome when she comes to ours.\" Imogen did not descend\n",
       "to self-exculpation. She spoke gently and gravely, casting only a glance at\n",
       "Sir Basil, as if calling him to witness her pained magnanimity.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It would be fun, you know, to help her to start a new one,\" said\n",
       "Rose;--\"something rebellious and anarchic. Will you help me if I do, Eddy?\n",
       "Come, let's sow discord in Imogen's Eden, like a couple of serpents.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Reptilian analogies seemed uppermost this morning; Imogen felt their\n",
       "fitness while, smiling on, she answered: \"I don't think that mere\n",
       "rebellion--not only against Eden but against the Tree of Knowledge as\n",
       "well--would carry you far, Rose. Your membership would be of three--Mattie\n",
       "and the two serpents.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Basil laughed out at the retort.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You evidently don't know the club and all those delightful young women,\"\n",
       "he said to Rose.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, yes, indeed I do. Every one sees Imogen's clubs. I don't think them\n",
       "delightful. Women in crowds are always horrid. We are only tolerable in\n",
       "isolation.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You hand over to us, then,\"--it was Jack who spoke, and with his usual\n",
       "impatience when bending to Rose's folly,--\"all the civic virtues, all the\n",
       "virtues of fraternity?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"With pleasure; they are becoming to nobody, for that matter. But I'm quite\n",
       "sure that men are brothers. Women never are sisters, however, unless,\n",
       "sometimes, we are sisters to you,\" Rose added demurely, at which Sir Basil\n",
       "gave a loud laugh.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen, though incensed, was willing that on this low ground of silly\n",
       "flippancy Rose should make her little triumphs. She kept her smile. \"I\n",
       "don't think that those of us who are capable of another sisterhood will\n",
       "agree with you,\" and her smile turned on Mary another coal of fire, for\n",
       "she suspected Mary of apostasy. \"I don't think that the women whose aim\n",
       "in life is--well--to make brothers of men in Rose's sense, can understand\n",
       "sisterhood at all, as, for instance, Mary and I do.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, you and Mary!\"--Rose tapped her eggshell and salted her egg. \"That's\n",
       "not sisterhood;--that's prophetess and proselyte. You're an anarchist\n",
       "to the bone, Imogen, like the rest of us;--you couldn't bear to share\n",
       "anything--It's like children playing games:--If I can't be the driver, I\n",
       "won't play horses.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, Rose!\" came in distressed tones from Mary; but Imogen did not flinch\n",
       "from her serenity.\n",
       "\n",
       "Outside on the veranda, where they all wandered after breakfast, her\n",
       "moment came at last. Jack had walked away with Mary; Miss Bocock, with a\n",
       "newspaper, stood in the shade at a little distance. Rose and Eddy were\n",
       "wandering among the flowers.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen knew, as she found herself alone with Sir Basil, that the impulse\n",
       "that rose in her was the crude one of simply snatching. She controlled its\n",
       "demonstration so that only a certain breathlessness was in her voice, a\n",
       "certain brilliancy in her eye, as she said to him, rapidly:--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He will never let you see me! Never!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"He? Who?--What do you mean?\" Sir Basil, startled, stared at her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Jack! Jack! Haven't you noticed?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, I see. Yes, I see.\" His glance became illuminated. In a voice as low\n",
       "as her own he asked: \"What does it mean?--I never can get a word with\n",
       "you. He's always there. He's very devoted to you, I know; but, I supposed\n",
       "that--well, that his chance was over.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "His hesitation, the appeal of his glance, were lightning-flashes of\n",
       "assurance for Imogen, opening her path for her.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is over;--it is over;--but it's false that he is devoted to me,\" she\n",
       "whispered. \"He hates me. He is my enemy.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, I say!\" gasped Sir Basil.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And since he failed to win me--Don't you see--It's through sheer\n",
       "spite--sheer hatred.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Her brilliant eyes were on him and a further \"Oh!\" came from Sir Basil as\n",
       "he received this long ray of illumination. And it was so dazzling, although\n",
       "Imogen, after her speech, had cast down her eyes, revealing nothing more,\n",
       "that he murmured hastily:--\"Can't I see you, Imogen, alone;--can't you\n",

       "wild confusion that, in another moment had built for her self-respect the\n",
       "shelter of a theory that, really, quite solidly sustained the statement so\n",
       "astounding to herself when it had risen to her lips. Hatred, spite; yes,\n",
       "these were motives, too, in Jack's treachery; she hadn't spoken falsely,\n",

       "Jack had drawn Mary aside, around the sunny veranda, and, out of ear-shot\n",
       "of everybody, a curious intentness in his demeanor, he asked her to run\n",
       "up to Mrs. Upton's room and ask her if she wouldn't take a drive with him\n",
       "that morning. Since the Uptons' impoverishment their little stable was,\n",
       "perforce, empty; and it was Jack who ordered the buggy from the village and\n",
       "treated the company in turn to daily drives.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mary departed on her errand, hearing Jack telephoning to the livery-stable\n",
       "as she went up-stairs.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had to own to herself that the charm had grown on her, and the fact of\n",
       "her increasing fondness for Imogen's mother made the clearer to her all the\n",
       "new, vague pain in regard to Imogen. Imogen, to Mary's delicate perception\n",
       "of moral atmosphere, was different; she had felt it from the moment of her\n",
       "arrival. No one had as yet enlightened her as to the Potts's catastrophe,\n",
       "but even by its interpretation she would have found the change hard to\n",
       "understand. Perhaps it was merely that she, Mary, was selfish and felt\n",
       "herself to be of less importance to Imogen. Mary was always conscious\n",
       "of relief when she could fix responsibility upon herself, and she was\n",
       "adjusting all sorts of burdens on her conscience as she knocked at Mrs.\n",
       "Upton's door.\n",
       "\n",
       "The post had just arrived, and Valerie, standing near her dressing-table,\n",
       "was reading her letters as Mary came in. Mary had never so helplessly felt\n",
       "the sense of charm as this morning.\n",
       "\n",
       "She wore a long white dressing-gown, of frilled lawn, tied with black\n",
       "ribbons at throat and wrists. Her abundant chestnut hair, delicately veined\n",
       "with white, was braided into two broad plaits that hung below her waist,\n",
       "and her face, curiously childlike so seen, was framed in the banded masses.\n",
       "Mary could suddenly see what she had looked like as a little girl. So\n",
       "moved was she by the charm that, Puritan as she was, she found herself\n",
       "involuntarily saying:--\"Oh, Mrs. Upton, what beautiful hair you have.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is nice, isn't it?\" said Valerie, looking more than ever like a child,\n",
       "a pleased child; \"I love my hair.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mary had taken one braid and was crunching it softly, like spun silk, in\n",
       "her hand. She couldn't help laughing out at the happy acceptance of her\n",
       "admiring speech; the charm was about her; she understood; it wasn't vanity,\n",
       "but something flower-like.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have heaps, too,\" said Valerie.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, but it's sand-colored. And I do it so horribly. It is so heavy and\n",
       "pulls back so.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I know; that's the difficulty with heaps of hair. But I had a very clever\n",
       "maid, and she taught me how to manage it. Sand-color is a lovely color as a\n",
       "background to the face, you know.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie rarely made personal remarks and rarely paid compliments. She had\n",
       "none of the winning allurements of the siren; Mary had realized that and\n",
       "was now realizing that genuine interest, even if reticent, may be the most\n",
       "fragrant of compliments.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I wish you would let me show you how to do it,\" Valerie added.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mary blushed. There had always been to her, in her ruthless hair-dressing,\n",
       "an element of severe candor, the recognition of charmlessness, a sort\n",
       "of homage paid to wholesome if bitter fact. Mrs. Upton was not, in her\n",
       "flower-like satisfaction, one bit vain; but Mary suspected herself of\n",
       "feeling a real thrill of tempted vanity. The form of the temptation was,\n",
       "however, too sweet to be rejected, and Mrs. Upton's hair was so simply\n",
       "done, too, though, she suspected, done with a guileful simplicity. It\n",
       "wouldn't look vain to do it like that; but, on the other hand, it would\n",
       "probably take three times as long to do; there was always the question of\n",
       "one's right to employ precious moments in personal adornment. \"How kind\n",
       "of you,\" she murmured. \"I am so stupid though. Could I really learn? And\n",
       "wouldn't it take up a good deal of my time every morning?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie smiled. \"Well, it's a nice way of spending one's time, don't you\n",
       "think?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This was, somehow, quite unanswerable, and Mary had never thought of it in\n",
       "that light. She sat down before Valerie's pretty, tipped mirror and looked\n",
       "with some excitement at the rows of glittering toilet utensils set out\n",
       "before her. She was sure that Mrs. Upton found it nice to spend a great\n",
       "deal of time before her mirror.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is so kind of you,\" she repeated. \"And it will be so interesting to see\n",
       "how you do it. And, oh, I am forgetting the thing I came for--how stupid,\n",
       "how wrong of me. It's a message from Jack. He wants to know if you will\n",
       "drive with him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And what are all the plans for to-day?\" Mrs. Upton asked irrelevantly,\n",
       "unpinning the clustered knobs at the back of Mary's head and softly shaking\n",
       "out the stringently twisted locks as she uncoiled them.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is _so_ kind of you;--but oughtn't I to take Jack his answer first?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"The answer will wait. He has his letters to see to now. What are they all\n",
       "doing?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, let me see; Rose is in the hammock and Eddy is talking to her.\n",
       "Imogen is going to take Miss Bocock to see her club.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, it is Imogen's club day, is it? She asked Miss Bocock?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Bocock asked her, or, rather, Jack told her that he had been telling\n",
       "Miss Bocock about it; it was Jack who asked. He knew, of course, that she\n",
       "would be interested in it;--a big, fine person like Miss Bocock would be\n",
       "bound to be.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Um,\" Valerie seemed vaguely to consider as she passed the comb down the\n",
       "long tresses. \"I don't think that I can let Imogen carry off Miss\n",
       "Bocock;--Miss Bocock can go to the club another day; I want to do some\n",
       "gardening with her this morning; she's a very clever gardener, did you\n",
       "know?--So I shall be selfish. Imogen can take Sir Basil; he likes walks.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mrs. Upton was now brushing, and very dexterously; but Mary, glancing at\n",
       "her with a little anxiety for the avowed selfishness, fancied that she was\n",
       "not thinking much about the hair. Mary could not quite interpret the change\n",
       "she felt in the lovely face. Something hard, something controlled was\n",
       "there.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But Jack?\"--she questioned.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, Jack can take you on the drive. You and he have seen very little of\n",
       "each other since you've come; such old friends as you are, too.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, we are,\" said Mary, gazing abstractedly at her own face, now, in the\n",
       "mirror, and forgetting both her own transformation and the face that bent\n",
       "above her. A familiar cloud of pain gathered within her and, suddenly, she\n",
       "found herself bursting out with:--\"Oh, Mrs. Upton--I am so unhappy about\n",
       "Jack!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie, in the mirror, gave her a keen, quick glance. \"I am, too, Mary,\"\n",
       "she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mary, at this, turned in her chair to look up at her:--\"You see, you feel\n",
       "it, too!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That _he_ is unhappy? Yes, I see and feel it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And you care;--I am sure that you care.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I care very much. I love Jack very much.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mary seized her hand and tears filled her eyes. \"Oh, you _are_ a dear!--One\n",
       "must love him when one really knows him, mustn't one?--Mrs. Upton, I've\n",
       "known Jack all my life and he is simply one of the noblest, deepest,\n",
       "realest people in the whole world.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am sure of that.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, then, can't you help him?\" Mary cried.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"How can I help him?--In what way?\" Valerie asked, her grave smile fading.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"With Imogen. It's that, you see, their alienation, that's breaking his\n",
       "heart.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Of course you've seen it all more clearly than I have,\" Mary went on,\n",
       "her hair about her face, her hand clasping Valerie's;--\"Of course you\n",
       "understand it, and everything that has happened to them. I love Imogen,\n",
       "too--please don't doubt that;--but, but, I can't but feel that it's _her_\n",
       "mistake, _her_ blindness that has been the cause. She couldn't accept it,\n",
       "you see, that he should--stand for a new thing, and be loyal to the old\n",
       "thing at the same time.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie, now, had sunken into a chair near Mary's, and one hand was still\n",
       "in Mary's hand, and in the other she still held a tress of Mary's hair. She\n",
       "looked down at this tress while she said:--\"But Imogen was right, quite\n",
       "right. He couldn't stand for the new thing and be loyal to the old.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Mary's eyes widened: \"You mean,--Mrs. Upton?--\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Just what you do. That _I_ am the cause.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She raised her eyes to Mary's and the girl became scarlet.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh,--you do see it all,\" she breathed.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"All, all, Mary. To Imogen I stand, I must stand, for the wrong; to\n",
       "Jack--though he can't think of me very well as 'standing' for anything,\n",
       "I'm not altogether in that category. So that his championship of me judges\n",
       "him in Imogen's eyes. Imogen has had a great deal to bear. Have you heard\n",
       "of the last thing? She has not told you? I have refused my consent to her\n",
       "having a biography of her father written. She had set her heart on it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, I hadn't heard anything. You wouldn't consent? Oh, poor Imogen!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It is, poor Imogen. In this, too, she has found no sympathy in Jack. All\n",
       "his sympathy is with me. It has been the end, for both of them. And it is\n",
       "inevitable, Mary.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, Mrs. Upton, what can I say--what can I think?--I don't seem to be able\n",
       "to see who is right and who is wrong!\" Mary covered the confusion of her\n",
       "thoughts by burying her face in her hands.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No; one can't see. That's what one finds out.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Of course, I have always thought Mr. Upton a very wonderful person,\" Mary\n",
       "murmured from behind her hands, her Puritan instinct warning her that\n",
       "now, when it gave her such pain, was the time above all others for a\n",
       "\"testifying,\" a \"bearing witness.\"--\"But I know that Jack never felt about\n",
       "that as I did. Of course I, too, think that the biography ought to be\n",
       "written.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie was silent, and her silence, Mary felt, was definitive.\n",
       "\n",
       "She wouldn't explain herself; she wouldn't seek self-exculpation; and\n",
       "while, with all her humility, Mary felt that as a little stinging, she felt\n",
       "it, also, as something of a relief. Mrs. Upton, no doubt, was indifferent\n",
       "as to her opinion of her rightness and her wrongness, and Mrs. Upton--there\n",
       "was the comfort of it,--was a person whom one must put on one side when\n",
       "it came to judgments. She didn't seem to belong to any of the usual\n",
       "categories. One didn't want to judge her. One was thankful for the haze she\n",
       "made about herself and her motives. That Jack understood her was, Mary felt\n",
       "sure, the result of some peculiar perspicacity of Jack's, for she didn't\n",
       "believe that Mrs. Upton had ever explained or exculpated herself to Jack,\n",
       "either. It even dawned on her that his perspicacity perhaps consisted\n",
       "mainly in the sense of trust that she herself was experiencing. She trusted\n",
       "Mrs. Upton, were she right, or were she wrong, and there was an end of it.\n",
       "With that final realization she uncovered her eyes and met her hostess's\n",
       "eyes again, eyes so soft, so clear, but with, in them, a look of suffering.\n",
       "Childlike, her hair folding behind her cheek and neck, she was faded,\n",
       "touched with age; Mary had never seen it so clearly. Somehow it made her\n",
       "even sorrier than the suffering she recognized.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, but it's been hard for you, too,\" she exclaimed, shyly but\n",
       "irrepressibly, \"everything, all of it. Just let me say that.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie had blushed her infrequent, vivid blush. She rose and came behind\n",
       "Mary's chair again, gathering up the abandoned tresses. But before she\n",
       "began to comb and coil she said, \"Thanks,\" leaning forward and, very\n",
       "lightly, kissing the girl's forehead.\n",
       "\n",
       "After that there was silence between them while the work of hair-dressing\n",
       "went on. Valerie did not speak again until, softly forming the contour of\n",
       "the transfigured head, she said, looking at Mary's reflection with an air\n",
       "of quiet triumph;--\"Now, is not that charming?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Charming; perfectly charming,\" Mary replied, vaguely; the tears were near\n",
       "her eyes.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You must come again, to-morrow, and do it under my supervision. It only\n",
       "needs this, now.\" She thrust two heavy tortoise-shell pins into the coils\n",
       "on either side of Mary's head.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Those beautiful pins! I am afraid I shall lose them!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But they are yours,--mementoes of the new era in hair-dressing. I have\n",
       "several of them. There, you are quite as I would have you,--as far as your\n",
       "head goes.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not as far as the rest of me goes, I'm afraid,\" said Mary, laughing in\n",
       "spite of herself, and lured from sadness.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I wish you'd let me make the rest of you to match,\" said Valerie. \"I've\n",
       "always loved dressing people up. I loved dressing my dolls when I was a\n",
       "child. That stiff shirt doesn't go with your head.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, it doesn't. I really don't see,\" said Mary tentatively, \"why one\n",
       "shouldn't regard dressing as a form of art; I mean, of course, as long as\n",
       "one keeps it in its proper place, as it were.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"To get it in its proper place is to dress well, don't you think. I found\n",
       "such a pretty lawn dress of mine in a trunkful of things put away here;\n",
       "it's a little too juvenile for me, now, and, besides, I'm in mourning. May\n",
       "I put you into it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But I should feel so odd, so frivolous. I'm such a staid, solemn person.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But the dress is staid, too,--a dear little austerity of a dress;--it's\n",
       "just as much you as that way of doing your hair is. Don't imagine that I\n",
       "would commit such a solecism as to dress you frivolously. Look; will you\n",
       "put this on at once,--to please me?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She had drawn the delicate thing, all falls and plaitings of palest blue,\n",
       "from a closet, and, shaking it out, looked up with quite serious eyes\n",
       "of supplication. It was impossible not to yield. Laughing, frightened,\n",
       "charmed, Mary allowed Mrs. Upton to dress her, and then surveyed herself\n",
       "in the long mirror with astonishment. She couldn't but own that it was\n",
       "herself, though such a transfigured self. She didn't feel out of place,\n",
       "though she felt new and strange.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Now, Mary, go down to them and see to it that they all do as I say,\"\n",
       "Valerie insisted. \"Imogen is to take Sir Basil to the club;--Miss Bocock\n",
       "is to garden with me--tell her particularly that I count upon her. Jack is\n",
       "to take you for a drive. And, Mary,\" she put her hand for a moment on the\n",
       "girl's shoulder, grave for all her recovered lightness;--\"you are not to\n",
       "talk of sad things to Jack. You must help me about Jack. You must cheer\n",
       "him;--make him forget. You must talk of all the things you used to talk of\n",
       "before--before either I or Imogen came.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "They were all on the veranda when Mary went down; all, that is, but Rose\n",
       "and Eddy. Sir Basil and Miss Bocock were deep in letters. Imogen, seated\n",
       "on a step, the sunlight playing over her fluttering black, endured--it was\n",
       "evident that enjoyment made no part of her feeling--a vivid and emphatic\n",
       "account from Jack of some recent political occurrence. He was even reading,\n",
       "here and there, bits from the newspaper he held, and Mary fancied that\n",
       "there was an unnatural excitement in his voice, an unusual eagerness in his\n",
       "eye, with neither of which had he in the least infected Imogen.\n",
       "\n",
       "On seeing Mary appear he dropped the newspaper and joined her in the hall,\n",
       "drawing her from there into the little library. \"Well?--Well?--\" he\n",
       "questioned keenly.\n",
       "\n",
       "He had no eyes for her transformation, Mary noted that, although Imogen, in\n",
       "the instant of her appearance, had fixed grave and astonished eyes upon\n",
       "her. She repeated her message.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Well, do you know,\" said Jack, \"we can't obey her. I'm so sorry;--I should\n",
       "have liked the drive with you, Mary, of all things; but it turns out that\n",
       "I can't take anybody this morning, I've some letters, just come, that must\n",
       "be answered by return. But, Mary, see here,\" his voice dropped and his\n",
       "keenness became more acute;--\"help me about it. See that she goes. She\n",
       "needs it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Needs it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Don't you see that she's worn out?\"\n",

       "his tense decisiveness.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She likes Sir Basil better\"; Jack said it in the freest manner, a manner\n",
       "that left untouched any deeper knowledge that they might both be in\n",
       "possession of. \"Imogen likes him better, too. It's for that, so that Imogen\n",

       "about your counter-demands, while I manage it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But Jack,--you bewilder me!--I ought to give my message. I hate managing.\"\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Valerie, standing on the last step of the stair, a little above him, paused\n",

       "\"Yes;--that is, no, not exactly; but the club had been arranged and Miss\n",
       "Bocock was eager about it and knew you wouldn't mind, especially as Sir\n",

       "\n",
       "\"That you couldn't go?--but you sent Mary to ask me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I had to waive my claim,--I've just had these letters\"; he held them up.\n",
       "\"Very important; they must be answered at once; it will take all my\n",

       "chance.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie was still on the step above him, fully illuminated, and, as, with\n",
       "that careful ease, he urged Sir Basil's eagerness upon her, he saw--with\n",
       "what a throb of the heart, for her, for himself--that her deep flush rose.\n",
       "\n",
       "Oh, she loved him. She couldn't conceal it, not from the eyes that watched\n",
       "her now. And was she glad of an unasked-for help, or did her pride suspect\n",
       "help and resent it? Above all did she know how in need of help she was?\n",
       "\n",
       "He hadn't been able to prevent his eyes from turning from the blush; they\n",
       "avowed, he feared, the consciousness that he would hide; but, after a\n",
       "little moment, in the same voice of determined, though cautious\n",
       "penetration, Valerie questioned: \"Is Imogen just gone?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She has been gone these fifteen minutes,\" said Jack, striving to conceal\n",

       "\"Yes; where is Mary? Is she left out of all your combinations?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She did probe, then, though her voice was so mild, the voice, only, of the\n",
       "slightly severe, slightly displeased hostess who finds her looms entangled.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mary always has a lot to do.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Sir Basil shall take Mary,\" said Valerie cheerfully, as though she picked\n",
       "up the thread and found a way out of the silly chaos of his making.\n",
       "\n",
       "And at this crisis, this check from the goddess who wouldn't be served,\n",
       "Jack's new skill rose to an almost sinister height. Without a flaw in their\n",
       "apparent candor, his eyes met hers while he said:--\"Please don't upset my\n",
       "little personal combination. It's very selfish of me, I know;--but I wanted\n",
       "to keep Mary for myself this morning. I've seen so little of her of late;\n",
       "and I need her to talk over my letters with; they're about things we are\n",
       "both interested in.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie looked fixedly at him while he made this statement, and he\n",
       "couldn't tell what her look meant. But, evidently, she yielded to his\n",
       "counter-stratagem, feeling it, no doubt, unavoidable, for the buggy just\n",
       "then drew up before the door, and the figure of Sir Basil appeared above.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I _am_ in luck!\" said Sir Basil. Excitement as well as eagerness was\n",
       "visible in him. Valerie did not look up at him, though she smiled vaguely,\n",
       "coming down from her step and selecting a parasol on her way to the door.\n",
       "Jack was beside her, and he saw that the flush still stayed. He seemed to\n",
       "see, too, that she was excited and eager, but, more than all, that she was\n",
       "frightened. Yet she kept, for him, her quiet voice.\n",
       "\n",
       "Before Sir Basil joined them she had time to say:--\"You are rather\n",
       "mysterious, Jack. If you have deep-laid plans, I would rather you paid me\n",
       "the compliment of showing me the deepest one at once. I am not being nasty\n",
       "to you,\" she smiled faintly. \"Find Mary at once, you must have wasted a lot\n",
       "of time already in getting to those letters.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack stood in the doorway while they drove off. Valerie, though now very\n",
       "pale, in the shadow of her hat, showed all her gay tranquillity, and she\n",
       "was very lovely. Sir Basil must see that. He must see that, and all the\n",
       "other things, that, perhaps, he had forgotten for a foolish moment.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack felt himself, this morning, in a category where he had never thought\n",
       "it possible that he should find himself. It was difficult to avoid the\n",
       "conviction that he had, simply, lied two or three times in order to send\n",
       "Mrs. Upton and Sir Basil off together in their long, swaying, sunny\n",
       "solitude. Jack had never imagined it possible that he should lie. But,\n",
       "observing, as he was forced to, the blot on his neat, clean conscience, he\n",
       "found himself considering it without a qualm. His only qualm was for its\n",
       "success. The drive would justify him. He almost swore it to himself, as\n",
       "Valerie's parasol disappeared among the trees. The drive would justify him,\n",
       "and reinstate Sir Basil. Unless Sir Basil were a fool, what he had done was\n",
       "well done.\n",
       "\n",
       "Yet, when they had disappeared, it was with the saddest drop to anxious, to\n",
       "gnawing uncertainty, that Jack turned back into the house. An echo of the\n",
       "fear that he had felt in Valerie seemed to float back to him. It was as if,\n",
       "in some strange way, he had handed her over to pain rather than to joy, to\n",
       "sacrifice rather than to attainment.\n",

       "XXVII\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack's morning was not a happy one. It was bad enough to have told so many\n",
       "fibs, or, at all events, to have invented so many opportune truths, and it\n",
       "was worse to have to go on inventing more of them to Mary, now that his\n",
       "dexterities had linked him to her.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mary looked, as was only too natural, much surprised, when he told her that\n",
       "his letters required her help. She looked still more so when she found how\n",
       "inadequate were their contents to account for such a claim.\n",
       "\n",
       "Indeed there was, apparently, but one letter upon which her advice could be\n",
       "of the least significance, and after she had given him all the information\n",
       "she had to give in regard to the charity for which it appealed, there was\n",

       "\n",
       "\"But--the letters that required the immediate answers?\" she asked.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack's excited, plausible manner had dropped from him. Mary felt it\n",
       "difficult to be severe when his look of dejection was piercing her heart;\n",
       "still, she felt that she owed it to him as well as to herself, she must see\n",
       "a little more clearly into how he had \"had things so.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He replied, his eye neither braving nor evading hers, that he had already\n",
       "answered them; and Mary, after a little pause, in which she studied her\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I'm afraid you'll understand me less when I make you a confession. I\n",

       "\n",
       "\"No,\" said Jack, but with more mildness and sadness than compunction;--\"I\n",
       "want to be straight with you, at all events. So I'd rather tell you. All I\n",
       "did was to say to Sir Basil that I found I couldn't take Mrs. Upton for the\n",
       "drive I'd promised, so that if he wanted to take my place, he was welcome\n",
       "to the buggy. He wanted to, of course. That went without saying.\"\n",

       "suggested their gardening, but that since she was going to drive with Sir\n",
       "Basil she could go off to the club, at once, too, with Imogen.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But, Jack!--what did you mean by it?\"--Mary, quite aghast, stared at her\n",
       "Machiavellian friend.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why, that Sir Basil should take her. That's all I meant from the\n",
       "beginning, when I proposed going myself. Do forgive me, you dear old brick.\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Done out of things?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, little things, if you like, young things. She's young, and she ought\n",
       "to have them. Say you forgive me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Of course, Jack dear, I forgive you, though I don't understand you. But\n",
       "that's not the point. Everything seems so queer, so twisted; every one\n",
       "seems different. And to find _you_ not straight is worst of all.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I promise you, it's my last sin,\" said Jack.\n",
       "\n",

       "smile encouraging him to lightness, he remarked on her changed aspect.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"So do forgive and forget. I had to confess, when I'd not been true to you.\n",

       "\"Yes, she did my hair and gave me the dress. She was so sweet and dear.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack lightly touched a plaited ruffle of the wide sleeve, and Mary felt\n",
       "that he had never less thought of her than when he so touched her dress.\n",
       "She put aside the deep little pang that gave her to say: \"It's true, Jack,\n",
       "she ought to have young things, just because they are going from her; one\n",
       "feels that: She oughtn't to be standing back, and giving up things, yet. I\n",
       "see a little what you mean. _Isn't_ it pretty?\" Still, with an absent hand,\n",
       "he lightly touched, here and there, a ruffle of her sleeve. \"But it's like\n",
       "her. I hardly feel myself in it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You've never so looked yourself,\" said Jack. \"That's what she does, brings\n",

       "\n",
       "Mrs. Upton and Sir Basil did not come back to lunch, and Imogen's face was\n",
       "somber indeed as she faced her guests at the table. Jack, vigilant and\n",
       "pitiless, guessed at the turmoil of her soul.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "Jack said that he had, and Mary, casting a wavering glance at him, saw\n",
       "that if he intended to sin no more, he showed, at all events, a sinful\n",
       "guilelessness of demeanor. She herself began to blush so helplessly and\n",
       "so furiously that Imogen's attention was drawn to her. Imogen, also, was\n",
       "vigilant.\n",
       "\n",

       "accomplice, struck in. \"None that would have particularly interested you,\n",

       "\n",
       "\"There were others, Mary,\" said Imogen, laughing a little, \"You needn't\n",
       "look so guilty on Jack's account.\" Mary gave her a wide, startled stare.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You see, Mary,\" said Rose, after lunch in the drawing-room, \"saints can\n",
       "sting.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"What was the matter!\" Mary murmured, her head still seemed to buzz, as\n",

       "afternoon, he saw from the rustic bench, where, finally, he had cast\n",
       "himself, the returning buggy climbing up through the lower woodlands.\n",
       "\n",
       "He felt that his heart throbbed heavily as he watched it, just catching\n",
       "glimpses, among the trees, of the white bubble of Valerie's parasol\n",
       "slanting against the sun. Yet there was a dullness in his excitement. It\n",
       "was over, at all events. He was sure that the last die was cast. And his\n",
       "own trivial and somewhat indecorous part, of shifter of scenes and puller\n",
       "of strings, was, he felt sure, a thing put by forever. He could help her\n",
       "no longer. And in a sort of apathy, he sat out there in the sunny green,\n",
       "hardly thinking, hardly wondering, conscious only of a hope that had become\n",
       "a mere physical sense of oppression and of an underlying sadness that had\n",
       "become, almost, a physical sense of pain.\n",
       "\n",
       "He had just consulted his watch and, seeing it wanted but ten minutes to\n",
       "tea-time, had got up and was moving away, when a sudden rustle near him, a\n",
       "pause, a quick, evasive footstep, warned him of some presence as anxious\n",
       "for solitude as himself.\n",
       "\n",
       "He stood still for a moment, uncertain as to his own best means of retreat,\n",
       "but his stillness misled, for, in another moment, Valerie appeared before\n",
       "him from among the branches of a narrow side path.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had come up to the woods directly; he saw that, for she still wore her\n",
       "hat; she had come to be alone and to weep; and, as she saw Jack, her pale\n",
       "face was convulsed, with the effort to control her weeping, into a strange\n",
       "rigor of pain and confusion.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh\"--he stammered. \"Forgive me. I didn't know you were here.\" He was\n",
       "turning to flee, as if from a sacrilege, when she recalled him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Don't--without me. I must go back, too,\" she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "She stepped on to the broader path and joined him, and he guessed that she\n",
       "tested, on him, her power to face the others. But, after they had gone a\n",
       "few steps together, she stopped suddenly and put her hands before her face,\n",
       "standing quite still.\n",
       "\n",
       "And Jack understood that she was helpless and that he must say nothing. She\n",
       "stood so for a long moment, not trusting herself to move or speak. Then,\n",
       "uncovering her face, she showed him strange eyes from which the tears had\n",
       "been crushed back.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And--I can do nothing?--\" he said at last, on the lowest breath, as they\n",
       "walked on.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nothing, dear Jack.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"When you are suffering like that!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I have no right to such suffering. I must hide it. Help me to hide it,\n",
       "Jack. Do I look fairly decent?\" She turned her face to him, with, he\n",
       "thought, the most valorous smile he had ever seen.\n",
       "\n",
       "Only a thin screen of leaves was between them and the open.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You look--beautiful,\" said Jack. She smiled on, as though that satisfied\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I do, dear Jack.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Not how much, not how much. You can't know that. It almost gives me my\n",
       "right, you know, to see. When will you talk to me?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Some time to-night, when we can have a quiet moment. I'll tell you about\n",
       "the things that have happened--nothing to make you sad, I hope. And I'll\n",
       "ask you some questions, too, Jack, about your very odd behavior!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Really she was wonderful; it was almost her own gaiety, flickering like\n",
       "pale sunlight upon her face, that she had regained, and, as they went\n",
       "together over the lawn to where the tea-table was laid in the shade, he saw\n",
       "that she could face them all. No one would know. And her last words had\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Oh, yes, you will be,\" she returned. \"You won't ask me to be candid.\n",

       "\n",
       "No one could guess; Sir Basil least of all. That was apparent to Jack as\n",
       "he watched them all sitting at tea under the apple-trees. Sir Basil had\n",
       "never looked so radiant, so innocent of any connection with suffering. He\n",
       "exclaimed over the beauties of their long drive. They had crossed hill and\n",
       "dale; they had lost their way; they had had lunch at a village hotel, an\n",
       "amusing lunch, ending with ice-cream and pie, and, from the undiminished\n",
       "reflection of his contentment on Valerie's features, Jack knew that any\n",
       "faintest hint of the pale, stricken anguish of the woodlands had never for\n",
       "an instant hovered during the drive. This was the face that Sir Basil had\n",
       "seen for all the happy, sunny, picnic day, this face of gay tranquillity.\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Basil and Mrs. Upton, indeed, expressed what gaiety there was among\n",
       "the group. Mary, in her blue lawn, looked very dreary. Rose and Eddy were\n",
       "ill-tempered, their day, plainly, having ended in a quarrel. As for Imogen,\n",
       "Jack had felt her heavy eye rest upon him and her mother as they came\n",
       "together over the lawn, and felt it rest upon her mother and Sir Basil\n",
       "steadily and somberly, while they sat about the tea-table. The long drive,\n",
       "Sir Basil's radiance, her mother's serenity, how must they look to Imogen?\n",
       "Jack could conjecture, though knowing, for his own bitter mystification,\n",
       "that what they looked like was perhaps not what they meant. Imogen must\n",
       "be truly at bay, and he felt a cruel satisfaction in the thought of her\n",
       "hidden, her gnawing anxiety. He was aware of every ring of falsity in her\n",
       "placid voice and of every flash of fierceness under the steeled calmness\n",
       "of her eye. He noticed, too, for the rest of the day, that, whatever\n",

       "ostentatiously she went away to her room after tea, saying that she had had\n",
       "bad news of an invalid _protégé_ and must write to her. She paused, as she\n",
       "went, to lean over Mary, a caressing hand upon her shoulder, and to speak\n",
       "to her in a low tone. Mary grew very red, stammered, and said nothing.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Miss Upton overworks, I think,\" observed Miss Bocock. \"I've thought that\n",
       "she seemed overstrained all day.\"\n",

       "\"What was it?\"\n",
       "\n",

       "unworthy ends. She meant, of course, I see that,--she meant that what she\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",

       "\n",
       "She rang for her white chuddah, told the maid to put out the lamps, and\n",
       "that she and Mr. Pennington would shut the house when they came in. From\n",
       "the darkened house they stepped into the warm, pale night. They went in\n",
       "silence over the lawn and, with no sense of choice, took the mossy path\n",

       "\n",
       "It was not until they were lost in the obscurity of the woods that Valerie\n",

       "\n",
       "He had followed along the path just behind her; but now he came to her side\n",

       "that Imogen and Sir Basil were going to be friends.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And the evening,\" said Valerie, \"when you showed me plainly, at last, that\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Yes;--I remember.\"\n",

       "\n",
       "Valerie stood still, breathing as if with a little difficulty after the\n",
       "gradual ascent. The tall trees about them were dark and full of mystery on\n",
       "the pale mysterious sky. Through the branches they could see the glint of\n",
       "the moon's diminished disk.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is terrible, you know,\" said Valerie, after they had stood in silence\n",

       "\n",
       "\"For both of you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Worse for me, because I cared more, really cared more.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, worse for her, for it is you who have judged and rejected her.\"\n",

       "calm, so surrounded by love and appreciation. And now\"--Valerie walked on,\n",
       "as if urged to motion by the controlled force of her own insistence. Was it\n",
       "an appeal to him that Imogen, dispossessed of the new love, might find\n",
       "again the old love opening to her? He clung to the hope, though with a\n",
       "sickening suspicion of its folly.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"By my coming, I have robbed her of everything,\" Valerie was saying,\n",
       "walking swiftly up the path and breathing as if with that slight\n",

       "intolerable sense of expectancy. \"She isn't secure;--she isn't calm. She is\n",
       "warped;--her faiths are warped. Her friends are changed to her. She has\n",
       "lost you. It's as if I had shattered her life.\"\n",

       "\"Everything that wasn't real you have shattered.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The rustic bench was reached and they paused there, though with no eyes for\n",
       "the shaft of mystic distance that opened before them. Jack's eyes were on\n",
       "her and he was conscious of a rising insistence in himself that matched and\n",
       "opposed her own.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But you must be sorry for her pain,\" said Valerie, and now, with eyes\n",
       "almost stern in their demand, she gazed at him;--\"you must be sorry that\n",
       "she has had to lose so much. And you would be glad, would you not, to think\n",
       "that real things, a new life, were to come to her?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He understood; even before the words, his fear, his presage, leaped forward\n",
       "to this crashing together of all his hopes. And it seemed to him that a\n",
       "flame passed through him, shriveling in its ardent wrath all trite\n",
       "reticences and decorums.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No; no, I should not be glad,\" he answered. His voice was violent; the\n",
       "eyes he fixed on her were violent. His words struck Imogen out of his life\n",
       "for ever.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Why are you so cruel?\" she faltered.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I am cruel for _you_. I know what you want to do. You are going to give\n",
       "her _your_ life.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Quick as a flash she answered--it was like a rapier parrying his\n",
       "stroke:--\"Give?--what have I to do with it, if it comes to her?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Everything! Everything!\" he cried.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Nothing. You are mistaken.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Ah,--you could keep it, you could keep it--if you tried.\" And now his eyes\n",
       "pleaded--pleaded with her, for her own life's sake, to keep what was hers.\n",
       "\"You have only to _show_ her to him, as you did to me.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You think--I could do that!--to my child!\"--Through the darkness her white\n",
       "face looked a wild reproach at him.\n",
       "\n",
       "He seized her hands:--\"It's to do her no wrong!--It's only to be true,\n",
       "consciously, to him, as you were true, unconsciously, to me. It's only, not\n",
       "to let her rob you--not to let her rob him.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Jack,\" she breathed heavily, \"these are things that cannot be said.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"They must--they must--now, between us. I have my right. I've cared\n",
       "enough--to do anything, so that she should not rob you!\" Jack groaned.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"She has not robbed me. It left me;--it went to her;--I saw it all. Even if\n",
       "I had been base enough, even if I had tried to keep it by showing her to\n",
       "him--as you say so horribly,--even then I should not have kept it. He would\n",
       "not have seen. Don't you understand;--he is not that sort of man. She will\n",
       "always be blue to him, and I will always be gold--though perhaps, now, a\n",
       "little tarnished. That's what is so beautiful in him--and so stupid. He\n",
       "doesn't see colors, as you and I do, Jack. That's what makes me sure that\n",
       "this is the happiest of fortunes for them both.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He had held her hands, gazing at her downcast face, its strength speaking\n",
       "from the shadow, its pain hidden from him, and now, before her resolution\n",
       "and her gentleness, he bent his head upon the hands he held. \"Oh, but _you,\n",
       "you, you_!--It's _you_ whose life is shattered!\" broke from him with a sob.\n",
       "\n",
       "For a long while she stood silent above him, her hands enfolding his, as\n",
       "though she comforted his grief. He found himself at length kissing the\n",
       "gentle hands, with tears, and then, caressing his bent head with a light\n",
       "touch, she said: \"Don't you see that the time has come for me to accept\n",
       "shatterings as in the order of things, dear Jack?--My mistake has been to\n",
       "believe that life can begin over again. It can't. One uses it up--merely by\n",
       "waiting. I've been an incurable girl till now;--and now, I've crashed from\n",
       "girlhood to middle-age in a week! It's been a crash, of course; the sort of\n",
       "crash one never mends of; but after to-day, after you sent me off with him,\n",
       "Jack, and I allowed myself, in spite of all my dread, my pride, my\n",
       "relinquishment, just one flicker of girlish hope,--after all this, I think\n",
       "that I must put on caps to show that I am really old at last.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "He lifted his head and looked at her. Her face was lovely, with the silver\n",
       "disk of the moon above it and, about it, the mystery and sadness of the\n",
       "tranquil woods. So lovely, so young, with almost the trembling touch of a\n",
       "tender mockery, like the trembling of moonlit water, upon it. And all that\n",
       "he found to say at last was:--\"What a fool he is.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She really smiled then, though tears sprang to her eyes with her\n",
       "comprehension of all that the helpless, boyish words struggled to subdue.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Thanks for that, dear Jack,--and for all the other mistakes,\" she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "There seemed nothing more to say, no questions to ask, or to answer. He\n",
       "must accept from her that her plight was irrevocable. It was as if he had\n",
       "seen a great stone rolled over the quivering, springing, shining fountain,\n",
       "sealing it, stilling it for ever. And, for his part, her word covered all.\n",
       "His \"mistakes\" needed no further revealing.\n",
       "\n",
       "They had turned and, in silence, were moving down the path again, when they\n",
       "heard, suddenly, the sound of light, swift footsteps approaching them. They\n",
       "paused, exchanging a glance of wonder; and Jack thought that he saw fear in\n",
       "Valerie's eyes. The day, already, had held overmuch of endurance for her,\n",
       "and it was not yet ended. In another moment, tall and illumined, Imogen\n",
       "appeared before them in the path.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack knew, in thinking it over afterward, that Imogen at her most baleful\n",
       "had been Imogen at her most beautiful. She had looked, as she emerged from\n",
       "shadow into light, like a virgin saint bent on some wild errand through the\n",
       "night, an errand brought to a proud pause, in which was no fear and no\n",
       "hesitancy, as her path was crossed by the spirits of an evil world. That\n",
       "was really just what she looked like, standing there before them, bathed in\n",
       "light, her eyes profound and stern, her hair crowning her with a glory of\n",
       "transmuted gold, her head uplifted with a high, unfaltering purpose. That\n",
       "the shock of finding them there before her was great, one saw at once; and\n",
       "one could gage the strength of her purpose from her instantaneous\n",
       "surmounting of the shock.\n",
       "\n",
       "And it was strange, in looking back, to remember how the time of colorless\n",
       "light and colorless shadow had seemed to divest them all of daily\n",
       "conventions and daily seemings. They might have been three disembodied\n",
       "souls met there in the moonlit woods and speaking the direct, unimpeded\n",
       "language of souls, for whom all concealments are useless.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh--it is _you_,\" was what Imogen said; much as the virgin saint might\n",
       "have greeted the familiar demons who opposed her quest. _You_, meant both\n",
       "of them. She put them together into one category of evil, saw them as one\n",
       "in their enmity to her and to good. And she seemed to accept them as very\n",
       "much what a saint might expect to find on such a nocturnal errand.\n",
       "\n",
       "Involuntarily Valerie had fallen back, and she had put her hand on Jack's\n",
       "shoulder in confusion more than in fear. Yet, feeling a menace in the\n",
       "white, shining presence, her voice faltered as she asked: \"Imogen, what are\n",
       "you doing here?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "And it was at this point that Imogen reached, really, her own culmination.\n",
       "Whatever shame, whatever hesitation, whatever impulsion to deceive when\n",
       "deception was so easy, she may have felt; to lie, when a lie would be so\n",
       "easily convincing, she rejected and triumphed over. Jack knew from her\n",
       "uplifted look that the moment would count with her always as one of her\n",
       "great ones one of the moments in which--as she had used to say to him\n",
       "sometimes in the days that were gone forever--one knew that one had \"beat\n",
       "down Satan under one's feet.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You have no right to ask me that,\" she said, \"but I choose to answer you.\n",
       "I have come here to meet Sir Basil.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Meet him?\" It was in pure bewilderment that Valerie questioned,\n",
       "helplessly, without reproach.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Meet him. Yes. What have you to say to it?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"But why meet him?--Why now?\" The wonder on Valerie's face had broken to\n",
       "almost merriment. \"Did he ask you to?--Really, really, he oughtn't to.\n",
       "Really, my child, I can't have you meeting Sir Basil in the woods at\n",
       "midnight.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"You can't have me meeting him in the woods at midnight?\" Imogen repeated,\n",
       "an ominous cadence, holding her head high and taking long breaths. \"You say\n",
       "that, dare say it, when you well know that I can meet him nowhere else and\n",
       "in no other way. It was _I_ who asked him to meet me here and it is here,\n",
       "confronted with you, if you so choose; it is here, before you and under\n",
       "God's stars, that I shall know the truth from him. I am not ashamed; I am\n",
       "proud to say it;--I love him. And though you scheme, and stoop and strive\n",
       "to take him from me--you, with Jack to help you--Jack to lie for you--as he\n",
       "did this morning,--I know, I know in my heart and soul that he loves me,\n",
       "that he is mine.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Jack!--Jack!\" Valerie cried. She caught him back, for he started forward\n",
       "to seize, to gag her daughter; \"Jack--remember, remember!--She doesn't\n",
       "understand!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh, he may strike me if he wills.\" Imogen had stood quite still, not\n",
       "flinching.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I don't want to strike you--you--you idiot!\"--Jack was gasping. \"I want to\n",
       "force you to your knees, before your mother--who loves you--as no one else\n",
       "who knows you will ever love you!\" And, helplessly, his old words, so\n",
       "trite, so inadequate, came back to him. \"You self-centered, you\n",
       "self-righteous, you cold-hearted girl!\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie still held his arm with both hands, leaning upon him.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Imogen,\" she said, speaking quickly, \"you needn't meet Sir Basil in this\n",
       "way;--there is nothing to prevent you from seeing him where and when you\n",
       "will. You are right in believing that he loves you. He asked me this\n",
       "morning for your hand. And I gave him my consent.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "From a virgin saint Imogen, as if with the wave of a wand, saw herself\n",
       "turned into a rather foolish genie, so transformed and then, ever so\n",

       "thereto when she heard these words of conformity to the traditions of\n",
       "dignified betrothal. And for once in her life, so bottled and so sealed,\n",
       "she looked, as if through the magic crystal of her mother's words,\n",
       "absolutely, helplessly foolish. It is difficult for a genie in a bottle to\n",
       "look contrite or stricken with anything deeper than astonishment; nor is it\n",
       "practicable in such a situation to fall upon one's knees,--if a genie were\n",
       "to feel such an impulse of self-abasement. It was perhaps a comfort to all\n",
       "concerned, including a new-comer, that Imogen should be reduced to the\n",
       "silence of sheer stupefaction; and as Sir Basil appeared among them it was\n",
       "not at him, after her first wide glance, that she looked, but, still as if\n",
       "through the crystal bottle, at her mother, and the look was, at all events,\n",
       "a confession of utter inadequacy to deal with the situation in which she\n",
       "found herself.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was Valerie, once more, who steered them all past the giddy whirlpool.\n",
       "Jack, beside her, his heart and brain turning in dizzy circles, marveled at\n",
       "her steadiness of eye, her clearness of voice. He would have liked to lean\n",
       "against a tree and get his breath; but this delicate creature, rising from\n",
       "her rack, could move forward to her place beside the helm, and smile!\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Sir Basil,\" she said, and she put out her hand to him so mildly that Sir\n",
       "Basil may well have thought his rather uncomfortable _rendezvous_ redeemed\n",
       "into happiest convention, \"here we all are waiting for you, and here we are\n",
       "going to leave you, you and Imogen, to take a walk and to say some of all\n",
       "the things you will have to say to each other. Give me your hand, Imogen.\n",
       "There, dear friend, I think that it is yours, and I trust her life to you\n",
       "with, my blessing. Now take your walk, I will wait for you, as late as you\n",
       "like, in the drawing-room.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "So was the bottled genie released, so did it resume once more the figure of\n",
       "a girl, hardly humbled, yet, it must be granted, deeply confused. In\n",
       "perfect silence Imogen walked away beside her suitor, and it may be said\n",
       "that she never told him of the little episode that had preceded his\n",
       "arrival. Jack and Valerie went slowly on toward the house. Now that she had\n",
       "grasped the helm through the whirlpool he almost expected that she would\n",
       "fall upon the deck. But, silently, she walked beside him, not taking his\n",
       "arm, wrapped closely in her shawl, and, once more inside the dark\n",
       "drawing-room, she proceeded to light the candles on the mantel-piece,\n",
       "saying that she would wait there until the others came in, smiling very\n",
       "faintly as she added:--\"That everything may be done properly and in order.\"\n",
       "Jack walked up and down the room, his hands deeply thrust into the pockets\n",
       "of his dining-jacket.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"As for you, you had better go to bed,\" Valerie went on after a moment. She\n",
       "had placed the candles on a table, taken a chair near them and chosen a\n",
       "review. She turned the pages while she spoke.\n",
       "\n",

       "Her eyes on the unseen print, she turned her pages, and now that they were\n",
       "out of the woods and surrounded by walls and furniture and everyday\n",
       "symbols, he saw that the pressure of his presence was heavier, and that she\n",
       "blushed a deep, weary blush. But she was able and willing quite to dispose\n",

       "\n",
       "\"Natural!--To suspect you!\"--\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Of what you wanted me to do?\" Valerie asked. \"Yes, it was quite natural, I\n",
       "think, and partly because of your manoeuvers, my poor Jack. I understand it\n",
       "all now. But the cause you espoused was already a doomed one, you see.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Oh!\" he almost groaned. \"_You_ doomed it! Don't you feel any pity for\n",

       "\n",
       "Valerie continued to look at her page, silently, for a moment, and it was\n",
       "now indeed as though his question found some reverberating echo in herself.\n",
       "But, in the silent moment, she thought it out swiftly and surely, grasping\n",
       "old clues.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"No, Jack,\" she said, and she was giving herself, as well as him, the final\n",
       "answer, \"I don't pity him. He will never see Imogen baffled, warped, at\n",
       "bay,--as we have. He will always see her crowned, successful, radiant. She\n",
       "will count tremendously over there, far more than I ever would, because\n",
       "she's so different, because she cares such a lot. And Imogen must count to\n",
       "be radiant. She will help him in all sorts of ways, give him a new life;\n",
       "she will help everybody. Do you remember what Eddy said of her, that if it\n",
       "weren't for people of the Imogen type the cripples would die off like\n",
       "anything!--That was true. She is one of the people who make the wheels of\n",
       "the world go round. And it's a revival for a man like Sir Basil to live\n",
       "with such a person. With me he would have faded back into the onlooker at\n",
       "life; with Imogen he will live. And then, above all, quite above all, he is\n",
       "in love with her. I think that he fell in love with her at first sight, as\n",
       "Antigone, at her loveliest, except for to-night; to-night was her very\n",
       "loveliest--because it was so real;--she would have claimed him from\n",
       "me--before me--if he had come then; and her belief in herself, didn't you\n",
       "see, Jack, how it illumined her?--And then, Jack, and this I'm afraid you\n",
       "are forgetting, Imogen is a good girl, a very good girl. I can trust him to\n",
       "her, you know. Her object in life will be to love him in the most\n",
       "magnificent way possible. His happiness will be as much of an end to her as\n",
       "her own.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was, perhaps, the culminating symptom of his initiation, of his\n",

       "perfectly still, his hands in his pockets, his head bent, his eyes steadily\n",
       "on her, now, finding nothing better to do than obey her first suggestion\n",
       "and go to bed, took her hand before going, put it to his lips--and his\n",

       "\n",
       "Imogen was, indeed, crowned and radiant. And, safe on her eminence,\n",
       "recovered from the breathlessness of her rather unbecoming vigorous ascent,\n",
       "she found her old serenity, her old benignity, safely enfolded her once\n",
       "more. In looking down upon the dusty lowlands, where she had been blind and\n",
       "bitter, she could afford to smile over herself, even to shake her head a\n",
       "little over the vehemence of her own fear and courage. It was to have\n",
       "lacked faith, to have lacked wisdom, the showing of such vehemence; yet,\n",
       "who knew, without it, perhaps, she might not have escaped the nets that had\n",
       "been laid for her feet, for Basil's feet, too, his strong and simple nature\n",
       "making him helpless before sly ambushes. Jack, in declaring himself her\n",
       "enemy, had effectually killed the last faint wailing that had so piteously,\n",
       "so magnanimously, sounded on for him in her heart. He had, by his\n",
       "trickster's dexterity, proved to her, if she needed proof, that she had\n",
       "chosen the higher. A man who could so stoop--to lies--was not the man for\n",
       "her. To say nothing of his iniquity, his folly was apparent. For Jack had\n",
       "behaved like a fool, he must see that himself, in his espousal of a lost\n",
       "cause.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack as delinquent stood plain, and she would accuse no one else. In the\n",
       "bottom of Imogen's heart lingered, however, the suspicion that only when\n",
       "her mother had seen the cause as lost, the contest as useless, had she\n",
       "hastily assumed the dignified attitude that, for the dizzy, moonlit moment,\n",
       "had, so humiliatingly, sealed her, Imogen, into the magic bottle. Imogen\n",
       "suspected that she hadn't been so wrong, nor her mother so magnanimous as\n",
       "had then appeared, and this secret suspicion made it the easier for her to\n",
       "accept the seeming, since to do that was to show herself anybody's equal in\n",
       "magnanimity. She was quite sure that her mother, in her shallow way, had\n",
       "cared for Basil, and not at all sure that she had relinquished her hope at\n",
       "the first symptom of his change of heart. But, though one couldn't but feel\n",
       "stern at the thought, one couldn't, also, repress something of pity for the\n",
       "miscalculation of the defeated love. To feel pity, moreover, was to show\n",
       "herself anybody's equal in heart;--Jack's accusations rankled.\n",
       "\n",
       "Yes; considering all things, and in spite of the things that, she must\n",
       "always suspect, were hidden, her mother had behaved extremely well.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And above all,\" Imogen thought, summing it up in terms at once generous\n",
       "and apt, \"she has behaved like the gentlewoman that she is. With all her\n",
       "littlenesses, all her lacks, mama is essentially that.\" And the sweetest\n",
       "moments of self-justification were those in which her heart really ached a\n",
       "little for \"poor mama,\" moments in which she wondered whether the love that\n",
       "had come to her, in her great sorrow, high among the pine woods, had ever\n",
       "been her mother's to lose. The wonder made her doubly secure and her mother\n",
       "really piteous.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was easy, her heart stayed on such heights, to suffer very tolerantly\n",
       "the little stings that flew up to her from the buzzing, startled world.\n",
       "Jack she did not see again, until the day of her wedding, only a month\n",
       "later, and then his face, showing vaguely among the shimmering crowd,\n",
       "seemed but an empty mask of the past. Jack departed early on the morning\n",
       "after her betrothal, and it was only lesser wonders that she had to face.\n",
       "Mary's was the one that teased most, and Imogen might have felt some\n",
       "irritation had that not now been so inappropriate a sensation, before\n",
       "Mary's stare, a stare that seemed to resume and take in, in the moment of\n",
       "stupefaction, a world of new impressions. The memory of Mary staring, with\n",
       "her hair done in a new and becoming way, was to remain for Imogen as a\n",
       "symbol of the vexatious and altered, perhaps the corrupted life, that she\n",
       "was, after all, leaving for good in leaving her native land.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Sir Basil!--You are going to marry Sir Basil, Imogen!\" said Mary.\n",

       "coming?--We fancied that everyone must be guessing, while we were finding\n",

       "\n",
       "\"No, I never saw it, never dreamed of it.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"It seemed so impossible? Why, Mary dear?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I don't know;--he is so much older;--he isn't an American;--you won't live\n",
       "in your own country;--I never imagined you marrying anyone but an\n",
       "American.\"\n",
       "\n",

       "express:--I thought that he was in love with your mother.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen smiled over the simplicity of the spoken surprises. \"I don't think\n",
       "that the question of years separates people so at one as Basil and I,\" she\n",
       "said. \"You would find how little such things meant, Mary mine, if your calm\n",
       "little New England heart ever came to know what a great love is. As for my\n",
       "country, my country will be my husband's country, but that will not make me\n",
       "love my old home the less, nor make me forget all the things that life has\n",
       "taught me here, any more than I shall be the less myself for being a bigger\n",
       "and better self as his wife.\" And Imogen looked so uplifted in saying it\n",
       "that poor, bewildered Mary felt that Mrs. Upton, after all, was right, one\n",
       "couldn't tell where rightness was. Such love as Imogen's couldn't be wrong.\n",
       "All the same, she was not sorry that Imogen, all transfigured as she\n",
       "undoubtedly was, should be going very far away. Mary did not feel happy\n",
       "with Imogen any longer.\n",
       "\n",
       "Rose took the tidings in a very unpleasant manner; but then Rose didn't\n",
       "count; in any circumstances her effrontery went without saying. One simply\n",
       "looked over it, as in this case, when it took the form of an absolute\n",
       "silence, a white, smiling silence.\n",
       "\n",
       "Oddly enough, from the extreme of Rose's anger, came Eddy's chance. She\n",
       "didn't tell Eddy that she saw his mother as robbed and that, in silence,\n",
       "her heart bled for her; but she did say to him, several days after Imogen's\n",
       "announcement, that, yes, she would.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I know that I should be bound to take you some day, and I'd rather do it\n",
       "just now when your mother has quite enough bothers to see to without having\n",
       "your anxieties on her mind! I'll never understand anyone so well as I do\n",
       "you, or quarrel with anyone so comfortably;--and besides,\" Rose added with\n",
       "characteristic impertinence, \"the truth is, my dear, that I want to be your\n",
       "mother's daughter. It's that that has done it. I want to show her how nice\n",
       "a daughter can be to her. I want to take Imogen's place. I'll be an\n",
       "extremely bad wife, Eddy, but a good daughter-in-law. I adore your mother\n",
       "so much that for her sake I'll put up with you.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Eddy said that she might adore any one as much as she liked so long as she\n",
       "allowed him to put up with her for a lifetime. They did understand each\n",
       "other, these two, and Valerie, though a little troubled by the something\n",
       "hard and bright in their warring courtship, something that, she feared,\n",
       "would make their path, though always illuminated, often rough, could\n",
       "welcome her new daughter with real gladness.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I know that you'll never care for me, as I do for you,\" said Rose, \"and\n",
       "that you will often scold me; but your scoldings will be my religion. Don't\n",
       "spare them. You are my ideal, you know.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "This speech, made in her presence, was, Imogen knew, intended as a cut at\n",
       "herself. She heard it serenely. But Rose was more vexatious than Mary in\n",
       "that she wasn't leaving her behind. Rose was already sparring with Eddy as\n",
       "to when he would take her over to England for a season of hunting. Eddy\n",
       "firmly held himself before her as a poor man, and when Rose dangled her own\n",
       "wealth before him remarked that she could, of course, go without him, if\n",
       "she liked. It was evident, in spite of sparring and hardness, that Rose\n",
       "wouldn't like at all; and evident, too, that Eddy would often be wheedled\n",
       "into a costly holiday. Imogen had to foresee a future of tolerance toward\n",
       "Rose. Their worlds would not do more than merge here and there.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen had, already, very distinct ideas as to her new world. It hovered as\n",
       "important and political; the business of Rose's world would be its\n",
       "relaxation only. For Imogen would never change colors, and her frown for\n",
       "mere fashion would be as sad as ever. She was not to change, she was only\n",
       "to intensify, to become \"bigger and better.\" And this essential stability\n",
       "was not contradicted by the fact that, in one or two instances, she found\n",
       "herself developing. She was glad, and in the presence of Mrs. Wake, gravely\n",
       "to renounce past errors as to the English people. Since coming to know\n",
       "Basil, typical of his race, its flower, as he was, she had come to see how\n",
       "far deeper in many respects, how far more evolved that English character\n",
       "was than their own,--\"their,\" now, signifying \"your.\" \"You really saw that\n",
       "before I did, dear Mrs. Wake,\" said Imogen.\n",
       "\n",
       "Already Imogen identified herself with her future husband so that the\n",
       "defects of the younger civilization seemed no longer her affair, except in\n",
       "so far as her understanding of them, her love of her dear country, and her\n",
       "new enlightenments, made her the more eager to help. And then they were all\n",
       "of the same race; she was very insistent on that; it was merely that the\n",
       "branch to which she now belonged was a \"bigger and better branch.\" Imogen\n",
       "was none the less a good American for becoming so devoutly English. From\n",
       "her knowledge of the younger, more ardent, civilization, her long training\n",
       "in its noblest school, she could help the old in many ways. England, in\n",
       "these respects, was like her Basil, before she had wakened him. Imogen felt\n",
       "that England, too, needed her. And there was undoubtedly a satisfaction in\n",
       "flashing that new world of hers, so large, so in need of her,--in flashing\n",
       "it, like a bright, and, it was to be hoped, a somewhat dazzling object,\n",
       "before the vexatiously imperturbable eyes of Mrs. Wake. Mrs. Wake's dry\n",
       "smile of congratulation had been almost as unpleasant as Rose's silence.\n",
       "\n",
       "From Miss Bocock there was neither smile, nor sting, nor silence to endure.\n",
       "Miss Bocock had suspected nothing, either on the mother's side or on the\n",
       "daughter's, and took the announcement very placidly. \"Indeed. Really. How\n",
       "very nice. Accept my congratulations,\" were her comments. Imogen at once\n",
       "asked her to spend a week-end at Thremdon Hall next Spring, and Miss Bocock\n",
       "in the same way said: \"Thanks. That will be very nice. I've never stayed\n",
       "there.\" There was still a subtle irritation in the fact that while Miss\n",
       "Bocock now accepted her, in the order of things, as one of the \"county\n",
       "people,\" as the gracious mistress of Thremdon Hall, as very much above a\n",
       "country doctor's family, she didn't seem to regard her with any more\n",
       "interest or respect as an individual.\n",
       "\n",
       "These, after all, were the superficialities of the situation; its deeper\n",
       "aspects were, Imogen felt, as yet unfaced. Her mother seemed quite content\n",
       "to let Imogen's silence stand for apology and retractation, quite willing\n",
       "to go on, for the little further that they had to go together, in an\n",
       "ambiguous relation. This was, indeed, Imogen felt, her mother's strength;\n",
       "she could, apparently, put up with any amount of ambiguity and probably\n",
       "looked upon it as an essential part of life. Perhaps, and here Imogen was\n",
       "conscious of a twinge of anxiety, she put up with it so quietly because she\n",
       "didn't recognize it in herself, in her own motives and actions; and this\n",
       "thought teased at Imogen until she determined that she must stand forth in\n",
       "the light and show her mother that she, too, was self-assured and she, too,\n",
       "magnanimous.\n",
       "\n",
       "She armed herself for the task by a little talk with Sir Basil, the nearest\n",
       "approach they ever allowed themselves to the delicate complexities in which\n",
       "they had come to recognize each other and out of which, to a certain\n",
       "extent, they had had to fight their way to the present harmony. She was\n",
       "with him, again, among the laurels, a favorite place with them, and Imogen\n",
       "sat on her former ledge of sunny rock and Sir Basil was extended beside her\n",
       "on the moss. She had been reading Emerson to him, and when the essay was\n",
       "finished and she had talked to him a little about the \"over-soul,\"--dear\n",
       "Basil's recollections of metaphysics were very confused,--she presently\n",
       "said to him, letting her hand slide into his while she spoke:--\"Basil,\n",
       "dearest,--I want to ask you something, and you must answer very truly, for\n",
       "you need never fear that I would flinch from any truth. Tell me,--did you\n",
       "ever,--ever care for mama?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Sir Basil, his hat tilted over his eyes, grew very red and looked down at\n",
       "the moss for some moments without replying.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Of course I know that, in some sense, you did care,\" said Imogen, a faint\n",
       "tremble in her voice, a tremble that, in its sweet acquiescence to\n",
       "something that was hurting her, touched him infinitely. \"I know, too, that\n",
       "there are loves and loves. I know that anything you may have felt for mama\n",
       "is as different from what you feel for me as lamplight is from daylight. I\n",
       "won't speak of it, ever, again, dear Basil; but for this once let me see\n",

       "\n",
       "\"I did care for her,\" Sir Basil jerked out at that;--\"quite tremendously,\n",
       "until I saw you. She will always be a dear friend, one of the dearest, most\n",
       "charming people I've ever known. And, no, it wasn't like lamplight, you\n",
       "know\";--something in that analogy was so hurting Sir Basil that it made\n",
       "him, for a moment, forget his darling's hurt;--\"that wasn't it. Though,\n",
       "it's quite true, you're like daylight.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"And--and--she?\"--Imogen accepted the restatement, though her voice\n",
       "trembled a little more.\n",
       "\n",
       "He now looked up at her, a clear, blue ray from his honest eyes. \"Well,\n",
       "there, you know, it _has_ been a relief. I could never tell, in the past;\n",
       "she showed me nothing, except that friendship; but since she has been free,\n",
       "since I've seen her over here, she has shown me quite clearly, that it was,\n",
       "on her side, only that.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen was silent for a long time. She didn't \"know\" at all. And there was\n",
       "a great deal to accept; more, oddly enough, than she had ever faced. She\n",
       "had always believed that it had been like lamplight to daylight. But,\n",
       "whatever it had been, the day had conquered it. And how dear, how noble of\n",
       "her lover to show, so unfalteringly, his loyalty to the past. It was with a\n",
       "sigh made up of many satisfactions that she said at last:--\"Dear mama;--I\n",
       "am so glad that I took nothing she cared for from her.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was on that afternoon that she found her time for \"standing forth in the\n",
       "light\" before her mother.\n",
       "\n",
       "She didn't want it to be indoors; she felt, vaguely, that four walls would\n",
       "make them too intimate, as it were; shut them into their mutual\n",
       "consciousness too closely. So that when she saw her mother, after tea,\n",
       "watering and gathering her flowers at the edge of the wood, she went out to\n",
       "her, across the grass, sweet and mild in the long white dress that she had\n",
       "worn since joy had come to her.\n",
       "\n",
       "She wished to be very direct, very simple, very sweet.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Mama, darling,\" she said, standing there beside her while Valerie, after a\n",
       "quiet glance up at her, continued to cut her roses;--\"I want to say\n",
       "something to you. This seems such a beautiful time to say deep, grave\n",
       "things in, doesn't it, this late afternoon hour? I've wanted to say it\n",
       "since the other night when, through poor Jack's folly of revenge and\n",
       "blindness, we were all put into such an ugly muddle, at such ugly\n",
       "cross-purposes.\" She paused here and Valerie, giving neither assent nor\n",
       "negation, said: \"Yes, Imogen?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I want to say to you that I am sorry, mama dear\";--Imogen spoke gravely\n",
       "and with emphasis;--\"sorry, in the first place, that I should so have\n",
       "misjudged you as to imagine that--at your time of life and after your\n",
       "sobering experience of life--you were involved in a love affair. I see,\n",
       "now, what a wrong that was to do to you--to your dignity, your sense of\n",
       "right and fitness. And I'm sorrier that I should have thought you capable\n",
       "of seconding Jack's attempts to keep from me a love that had drawn to me as\n",
       "a magnet to the north. The first mistake led to the second. I had heard\n",
       "your friends conjecturing as to your feeling for Basil, and the pain of\n",
       "suspecting that of you--my father's new-made widow--led me astray. I think\n",
       "that in any great new experience one's whole nature is perhaps a little\n",
       "off-balance, confused. I had suffered so much, in so many ways;--_his_\n",
       "death;--Jack's unworthiness;--this fear for you;--and then, in these last\n",
       "days, for what you know, mama, for _him_, because of _him_--my father, a\n",
       "suffering that no joy will ever efface, that I was made, I think, for a\n",
       "little time, a stranger to myself. And then came love--wonderful love--and\n",
       "it shook my nature to its depths. I was dazzled, torn, tempest-tossed;--I\n",
       "did not see clearly. Let that be my excuse.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie still stopped over her roses, her fingers delicately, accurately\n",
       "busy, and her face, under the broad brim of her hat, hidden.\n",
       "\n",
       "Again Imogen paused, the rhythm of her words, like an echo of his voice in\n",
       "her own, bringing a sudden sharp, sweet, reminiscence of her father, so\n",
       "that the tears had risen to her eyes in hearing herself. And again, for all\n",
       "reply, her mother once more said only: \"Yes, Imogen.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "It was not the reply she had expected, not the reply that she had a right\n",
       "to expect, and, even out there, with the flowers, so impersonally lovely,\n",
       "about them, the late radiance softly bathing them, as if in rays of\n",
       "forgiveness and mild pity, even with the tears, evidences of sorrow and\n",
       "magnanimity, in her eyes, Imogen felt a little at a loss, a little\n",
       "confused.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"That is, all, mama,\" she said;--\"just that I am sorry, and that I want you\n",
       "to feel, in spite of all the sad, the tragic things that there have been\n",
       "between us, that my deep love for you is there, and that you must trust it\n",
       "always.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "And now there was another silence. Valerie stooping to her flowers,\n",
       "mysterious, ambiguous indeed, in her shadow, her silence.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen, for all the glory of her mood, felt a thrill of anger, and the\n",
       "reminiscence that came to her now was of her father's pain, his familiar\n",
       "pain, for such shadows, such silences, such blights cast upon his highest\n",
       "impulses. \"I hope, mama, that you will always trust my love,\" she said,\n",
       "mastering the rising of her resentment.\n",
       "\n",
       "And once more came the monotonous answer, but given this time with a new\n",
       "note:--\"Yes, Imogen,\" her mother replied, \"you may always trust my love.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She rose at that, and her eyes passed swiftly across her daughter's face,\n",
       "swiftly and calmly. She was a little flushed, but that might have been from\n",
       "the long bending over the flowers, and if it was a juggling dexterity that\n",
       "she used, she had used it indeed so dexterously that it seemed impossible\n",
       "to say anything more. Imogen could find no words in which to set the turned\n",
       "tables straight.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had imagined their little scene ending very beautifully in a grave\n",
       "embrace and kiss; but no opportunity was given her for this final\n",
       "demonstration of her spirit of charity. Her mother gathered up her\n",
       "scissors, her watering-pot, her trowel, and handing Imogen the filled\n",
       "basket of roses said, \"Will you carry these for me, my dear?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The tone of quiet, everyday kindness dispelled all glory, and set a lower\n",
       "standard. Here, at this place, very much on the earth, Imogen would always\n",
       "find her, it seemed to say. It said nothing else.\n",
       "\n",
       "Yet Imogen knew, as she walked back beside her mother, knew quite as well\n",
       "as if her mother had spoken the words, that her proffered love had not been\n",
       "trusted, that she had been penetrated, judged, and, in some irresistible\n",
       "way, a way that brought no punishment and no reproof, nor even any\n",
       "lessening of affection, condemned. Her mother still loved her, that was the\n",
       "helpless conviction that settled upon her; but it was as a child, not as a\n",
       "personality, that she was loved,--very much as Miss Bocock respected her as\n",
       "the mistress of Thremdon Hall and not at all on her own account; but her\n",
       "mother, too, for all her quiet, and all her kindness, thought her\n",
       "\"self-centered, self-righteous, cold-hearted,\" and--Imogen, in a sharp pang\n",
       "of insight, saw it all--because of that would not attempt any soul-stirring\n",
       "appeal or arraignment. She knew too well with what arms of spiritual\n",
       "assurance she would be met.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was in silence, while they walked side by side, the basket of roses\n",
       "between them, that Imogen fiercely seized these arms, fiercely parried the\n",
       "unuttered arraignment, and, more fiercely, the unuttered love.\n",
       "\n",
       "She could claim no verbal victory, she had had to endure no verbal defeat;\n",
       "it was she herself who had forced this issue upon a situation that her\n",
       "mother would have been content to leave undefined. Her mother would never\n",
       "fix blame; her mother would never humiliate; but, she had found it to her\n",
       "own cost,--though the cost was as light as her mother could make it--she\n",
       "would not consent to be placed where Imogen had wished to place her. Let it\n",
       "be so, then, let it end on this note of seeming harmony and of silent\n",
       "discord; it was her mother's act, not her own. Truth was in her and had\n",
       "made once more its appeal; once more deep had called to deep only to find\n",
       "shallowness. For spiritual shallowness there must be where an appeal such\n",
       "as hers could be so misunderstood and so rejected.\n",
       "\n",
       "She was angry, sore, vindictive, though her sharp insight did not reach so\n",
       "far as to tell her this; it did, however, tell her that she was wounded to\n",
       "the quick. But the final refuge was in the thought that she was soon to\n",

       "\n",
       "Two months were gone since Imogen's reporter-haunted nuptials had been\n",
       "celebrated in the bland little country church that raised its white steeple\n",
       "from the woodlands. Jack had been present at them; decency had made that\n",
       "necessary, and a certain grimness in his aspect was easily to be\n",
       "interpreted in a dismal, defeated rival. It was as such, he knew, that he\n",
       "was seen there.\n",
       "\n",
       "It had been a funny wedding,--to apply none of the other terms that lay\n",
       "deeper in him. In watching it from the white-wreathed chancel he had\n",
       "thought of Valerie's summing-up: \"Imogen is one of the people who make the\n",
       "world go round.\" The world in every phase had been there, from the British\n",
       "ambassador and the Langleys to the East Side club girls--brought up from\n",
       "New York in the special train--and a flourishing consignment of cripples\n",
       "and nurses. Here and there in her path Imogen might meet the blankness of a\n",
       "Miss Bocock, the irony of a Mrs. Wake, a disillusion like Mary's, an\n",
       "insight like his own; but the great world, in its aspect of power and\n",
       "simplicity, would be with her always. He had realized as never before\n",
       "Imogen's capacity, when he saw the cohorts of her friends and followers\n",
       "overflow the church.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had been a fitting center to it all; though the center, for Jack, was\n",
       "Valerie, exquisite, mildly radiant, not a hint on her of dispossession or\n",
       "of doom; but Imogen, white and rapt and grave, had looked almost as\n",
       "wonderful as on the day when she had first dawned upon Sir Basil's vision.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack, watching her uplifted profile as she stood at the altar-rail, found\n",
       "himself trivially, spitefully, irrelevantly murmuring:--\"Her nose _is_ too\n",
       "small.\" And yet she looked more than ever like a Botticelli Madonna.\n",

       "Rose and Eddy were to be married that winter in New York, a gigantic\n",

       "\n",
       "Valerie was to have none of the bother of this wedding. Mrs. Packer, a\n",

       "emergencies. Her secretaries sat already with pens poised.\n",
       "\n",
       "Imogen's wedding had kept her mother working like a galley-slave, so Rose\n",
       "told Jack, with the familiarity that was now justifiable in one who was\n",
       "almost of the family, and that Eddy had told her, with much disgust of\n",
       "demeanor, that its financing had eaten pretty deeply into his mother's\n",
       "shrunken means. Rose made no open denunciation; she, no more than anyone\n",
       "else, could guess from Jack's silence what his feeling about Imogen might\n",
       "really be. But she was sure that he was well _over_ her, and that, above\n",
       "all, he was one of the elect who _saw_ Mrs. Upton; she could allow herself\n",
       "a musing survey of all that the mother had done for the daughter, adding,\n",
       "and it was really with a wish for strict justice: \"Of course Imogen never\n",
       "had any idea of money, and she'll never realize what she cost.\" In another\n",
       "and a deeper sense it might be that that was the kindest as well as the\n",

       "Since the wedding he knew that Valerie had been quietly at the little house\n",

       "Now Mrs. Wake was gone back to New York, and her own departure was to take\n",
       "place in a few days. Jack, spending a week-end with friends not beyond\n",

       "he had come to know her so well and to know himself as so changed.\n",
       "\n",
       "He rode over the crests of hills in the flaming, aromatic woods. The fallen\n",
       "leaves paved his way with gold. In the deep distances, before him a still,\n",
       "blue haze, like the bloom on ripe grape-clusters, lay over the purples of\n",
       "the lower ranges. Above, about, before him was the blue sky of the\n",
       "wonderful American \"fall,\" high, clear, crystalline. The air was like an\n",
       "elixir. Jack's eyes were for all this beauty,--\"the vast, unconscious\n",
       "scenery of my land,\" the line that drifted in his thoughts,--his own\n",
       "consciousness, taken up into his contemplation, seeming as vast and as\n",
       "unperplexed. But under his calm, his happy sadness, that, too, seemed a\n",
       "part of the day, ran, like the inner echo to the air's intoxication, a\n",
       "stream of deep, still excitement.\n",
       "\n",
       "He did not think directly of Valerie, but vague pictures passed,\n",
       "phantom-like, before his mind. He saw her in her garden, gathering late\n",
       "flowers; he saw her reading under the fringe of vine-leaves and tendrils;\n",
       "he saw her again in the wintry New York of snow, sunlight, white, gold and\n",
       "blue, or smiling down from the high-decked steamer against a sky of frosty\n",
       "rose; he saw her on all possible and adequate backgrounds of the land he so\n",
       "loved. But,--oh, it was here that the under-current, the stream of\n",
       "excitement seemed to rise, foaming, circling, submerging him, choking him,\n",
       "with tides of grief and desolation,--seeing her, too, in that land she\n",
       "loved;--not in the Surrey garden, no, no,--that was shut to her for\n",
       "ever;--but in some other, some distant garden, high-walled, the pale gold\n",
       "and gray of an autumnal sunset over its purpling bricks, or on a\n",
       "flower-dappled common in spring, or in spring woods filled with wild\n",
       "hyacinths and primroses. How he could see her, place her, over there, far,\n",
       "far away, from his country--and from him.\n",
       "\n",
       "It was, after the last sharp trot, the last leisurely uphill canter, on the\n",
       "bordering, leaf-strewn grass of the winding road, where the white walls and\n",
       "gray roof of the little house showed among the trees, that all the\n",
       "undercurrent seemed to center in a knot of suffocating expectancy and pain.\n",
       "\n",
       "And Valerie, while Jack so rode, so approached her, was fulfilling one of\n",
       "his visions. She had spent the afternoon in her garden, digging, planting,\n",
       "\"messing\" as she expressed it, very happily among her borders, where late\n",
       "flowers, purple and white and gold, still bloomed. She was planning all\n",
       "sorts of things for her garden, a row of double-cherry-trees to stand at\n",
       "the edges of the woods and be symbols of paradise in spring, with their\n",
       "deep upon deep of miraculous white. Little almond-trees, too, frail sprays\n",
       "of pink on a spring sky, and quince-trees that would show in autumn among\n",
       "ample foliage the pale gold of their softly-furred fruit. She wanted spring\n",
       "flowers to run back far into the woods, the climbing roses and honeysuckle\n",
       "to make summer delicious among the vines of the veranda. The afternoon,\n",
       "full of such projects, passed pleasantly, and when she came in and dressed\n",
       "for her solitary tea, she felt pleasantly tired. She walked up and down the\n",
       "drawing-room, its white walls warm with the reflections of outer sunlight,\n",
       "listening vaguely to the long trail of her black tea-gown behind her,\n",
       "looking vaguely from the open windows at the purple distances set in their\n",
       "nearer waves of flame.\n",
       "\n",
       "At the end of the room, before the austere little mantelpiece, she paused\n",
       "presently to look at herself in the austere little mirror with its\n",
       "compartments of old gilt; at herself, the illuminated white of the room\n",
       "behind her reflection. A narrow crystal vase mirrored itself beside her\n",
       "leaning arm, and its one tall rose, set among green leaves and russet stems\n",
       "and thorns, spread depths of color near her cheek. Valerie's eyes went from\n",
       "her face to the rose. The rose was fresh, glowing, perfect. Her face,\n",
       "lovely still, was faded.\n",
       "\n",
       "She stood there, leaning beside the flower, the fingers of her supporting\n",
       "hand sunken deep in the chestnut masses of her hair, and noted, gravely,\n",
       "earnestly, the delicate signs and seals of stealing age.\n",
       "\n",
       "Never, never again would her face be like the rose, young, fresh, perfect.\n",
       "And she herself was no longer young; in her heart she knew the stillness,\n",
       "the droop, the peace--almost the peace--of softly-falling petals.\n",
       "\n",
       "How young she had been, how lovely, how full of sweetness. That was the\n",
       "thought that pierced her suddenly, the thought of wasted sweetness,\n",
       "unrecorded beauty, unnoted, unloved, all to go, to pass away for ever. It\n",
       "seemed hardly for herself she grieved, but for the doom of all youth and\n",
       "loveliness; for the fleeting, the impermanence of all life. The vision of\n",
       "herself passed to a vision of the other roses, the drooping, the doomed,\n",
       "scattering their petals in the chill breeze of coming winter.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Poor things,\" was her thought,--her own self-pity had part only in its\n",
       "inclusiveness,--\"summer is over for all of us.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "And with the thought, girlishly, still girlishly, she hid her face upon her\n",
       "arms as she stood there, murmuring:--\"Ah, I hate, I hate getting old.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "A step at the door roused her. She turned to see Jack entering.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack looked very nice in the tans and russets of his riding-tweeds and\n",
       "gaiters. The chill air had brought a clear color to his cheeks; the pale\n",
       "gold of his hair,--one unruly lock, as usual, over-long, lying across his\n",
       "forehead,--shone like sunlight; his gray eyes looked as deep and limpid as\n",
       "a mountain pool.\n",
       "\n",
       "Valerie was very, very glad to see him. He embodied the elixir, the color,\n",
       "the freshness of the world to-day: and oh how young--how young--how\n",
       "fortunately, beautifully young he looked;--that was the thought that met\n",
       "him from the contrast of the mirror.\n",
       "\n",
       "She gave him her hands in welcome, and they sat down near a window where\n",
       "the sunlight fell upon them and the breeze blew in upon them, she on a\n",
       "little sofa, among chintz cushions, he on a low chair beside her; and while\n",
       "they talked, that excitement, that pain and expectancy grew in Jack.\n",
       "\n",
       "The summer was over and, soon, it must be, she would go. With a wave of\n",
       "sadness that sucked him back and swept him forward in a long, sure ache,\n",
       "came the knowledge, deeper than before, of his own desolation. But, sitting\n",
       "there beside her in the October sunlight; feeling, with the instinct, so\n",
       "quick, so sensitive in him, that it was in sadness he had found her, the\n",
       "desolation wasn't so much for himself as for her, what she represented and\n",
       "stood for. He, too, seeing her face with the blooming rose beside it, had\n",

       "her, as the evening fell over the wide earth, it was now or never that he\n",
       "could receive the last illumination. He hardly saw clearly what that might\n",
       "be; it wavered like a hovering light behind the mist.\n",
       "\n",
       "He rose and walked up and down the room a little; pausing to look from the\n",

       "\n",
       "\"So, our summer is at an end,\" he said, turning at last from the window.\n",

       "of the things I would not like to leave.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Again he walked up and down, and seemed to hear the steady flow of that\n",
       "still, deep excitement. Why, above it, should he say silly, meaningless\n",
       "words, that were like a bridge thrown over it to lead him from her?\n",
       "\n",
       "\"I want to tell you one thing, just one, before I go,\" he said. He knew\n",
       "that, with his sudden resolution, his voice had changed and, to quiet\n",
       "himself, he stood before her and put both hands on the back of a chair that\n",
       "was between them. He couldn't go on building that bridge. He must dare\n",
       "something, even if something else he must not dare--unless, unless she let\n",
       "him. \"I must tell you that you are the most enchanting person I have ever\n",
       "known.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She looked at him quietly, though she was startled, not quite\n",
       "understanding, and she said a little sadly: \"Only that, Jack?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Yes, only that, for you, because you don't need the trite, obvious labels\n",
       "that one affixes to other people. You don't need me to say that you are\n",
       "good or true or brave;--it's like a delicate seal that comprises and\n",
       "expresses everything,--the trite things and the strange, lovely\n",
       "things--when I say that you are enchanting.\" He held his mind, so\n",
       "conscious, under the words, of what he must not say, to the intellectual\n",
       "preoccupation of making her see, at all events, just what the words he\n",

       "\n",
       "But as his voice rang, tense, vibrant as a tightened cord in the still\n",

       "sudden echo to all he dared not say.\n",
       "\n",
       "She had never seen, quick as she was to see the meaning behind words and\n",
       "looks. She suspected that he, also, had never seen it clearly till now.\n",
       "\n",
       "Other claims had dropped from them; the world was gone; they were alone,\n",

       "\n",
       "Yes, she had it still, the gift, the compelling charm. His eyes in their\n",
       "young strength and fear and adoration called to her life, and with a touch,\n",
       "a look, she could bring to it this renewal and this solace. And, behind her\n",
       "sorrow, her veil, her relinquishment, Valerie was deeply thrilled.\n",
       "\n",
       "The thrill went through her, but even while she knew it, it hardly moved\n",
       "her. No; the relinquishment had been too deep. She had lost forever, in\n",
       "losing the other. That had been to turn her back on life, or, rather, to\n",
       "see it turn its back on her, forever. Not without an ugly crash of inner,\n",
       "twisted discord could she step once more from the place of snow, or hold\n",
       "out her hand to love.\n",
       "\n",
       "All his life was before him, but for her--; for her it was finished. And as\n",
       "she mastered the thrill, as she turned from the vision of what his eyes\n",
       "besought and promised, a flow of pity, pity for his youth and pain and for\n",
       "all the long way he was yet to go, filled her, bringing peace, even while\n",
       "the sweetness of the unsought, undreamed of offering made her smile again,\n",
       "a trembling smile.\n",
       "\n",
       "\"Dear Jack, thank you,\" she said.\n",
       "\n",
       "Suddenly, before her smile, her look, he flushed deeply, taking from her\n",
       "eyes what his own full meaning had been. Already it was in the past, the\n",
       "still-born hope; it was dead before he gazed upon it; but he must hear the\n",
       "death-warrant from her lips, it was not enough to see it, so gentle, so\n",
       "pitiful, so loving, in her eyes, and he heard himself stammering:--\"You--\n",
       "you haven't anything else you can say to me?\"\n",
       "\n",
       "She had found her answer in a moment, and now indeed she was at the helm,\n",
       "steering them both past white shores, set in such depths of magical blue,\n",
       "white shores where sirens sang. Never could they land there, never listen\n",
       "to the song. And already she seemed to hear it, as if from a far distance,\n",
       "ringing, sharp and strange with the swiftness of their flight, as she\n",
       "replied: \"Nothing else, dear Jack, except that I wish you were my son.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "The enchanted island had sunk below the horizon. They were landed, and on\n",
       "the safest, sanest, shores. She knew that she had achieved her own place,\n",
       "and that from it, secure, above him, the veil between them, her smile was\n",
       "the smile of motherhood. To smile so was to put before him finally the fact\n",
       "that her enchantment contradicted and helplessly lured him to forget. She\n",
       "would never forget it now, nor could he. She was Imogen's mother, and she\n",
       "was old enough to be his.\n",
       "\n",
       "From her smile, her eyes, common-sense flooded Jack, kind, yet stinging,\n",
       "too, savoring of a rescue from some hidden danger,--not his--not his--his\n",
       "was none of the common-sense,--but hers. He might had she let him, have so\n",
       "dislocated her life.\n",
       "\n",
       "He was scarlet, stammering. He knew that he hid nothing from her now, that\n",
       "he didn't want or need to hide anything. Those benign, maternal eyes would\n",
       "understand. And he smiled, too, but also with a trembling smile, as he\n",
       "reached out to her hand, holding it tightly and saying, gazing at her:--\"I\n",
       "love you so.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "Her hand held his, in farewell now, but her look up at him promised\n",
       "everything, everything for the future,--except the one now shrouded thing.\n",
       "\"And I love you, dear Jack,\" she said. \"You have taken the place of--almost\n",
       "everything.\"\n",
       "\n",
       "And then, for she saw the tears in his eyes, and knew that his heart was\n",
       "bleeding, not for himself alone, she rose and took his head between her\n",
       "hands, and, like a mother, kissed him above his eyes.\n",

       "The sky was like a deep rose, soft, dim, dying, and the color of the\n",
       "afterglow filled the room.\n",
       "\n",
       "Standing at the window she breathed in the keen, sweet air, and looked from\n",

       "heart followed his aching heart with comprehending pity. But, from her\n",
       "conquest of the thrill, a clear, contemplative insight was left with her,\n",

       "that the Surrey cottage stood for in her life, all the things that she had\n",
       "left to come to Imogen. She remembered. And, for a moment, the old vortex\n",

       "pang of that parting. She would not dwell on that. Eddy and Rose; to turn\n",
       "to them was to feel almost gay. Jack and Mary;--yes, on these last names\n",

       "be.\n",
       "\n",
       "Jack would not know how her maternal solicitude was to encompass him and\n",
