       "and charging the purims. The purims knotted around the Gadaran infantry\n",
       "while sorcerers cast hellfire. A haze of brown smoke hung above the\n",
       "battlefield. The purims were as numerous as before, but the snarling\n",

       "\n",
       "The battle shifted, an unspoken moment when the largest of the purims\n",

       "packs able to follow trailed after their leader, and Tyrus kicked bodies\n",
       "out of his way to make room. His hill was littered with dead and dying\n",
       "monsters. The big one stood about ten feet tall and carried a club that\n",
       "looked like a tree trunk. His snout was filled with white scars, and he\n",
       "had one ear. Littler demon spawn scrabbled out of his way when he took\n",
       "the hill at a run. Tyrus meant to charge as well, but he tripped on a\n",
       "dead body and slid to one knee. The purim altered his swing, and the\n",
       "club thudded into Tyrus’s shoulder.\n",
       "\n",

       "sword. The blow left him dazed, and while he found his feet, he\n",
       "struggled to focus his eyes. He shook his head and saw a large shape\n",
       "hurtling toward him.\n",
       "\n",
       "He dove out of the way. The club hit hard enough to shake the ground.\n",
       "Tyrus found his feet and rolled out from under another swing. The club\n",
       "sank into the ground, and while the purim snarled and pulled at the\n",
       "club, Tyrus slashed its wrists. Howling in pain, the purim pulled back\n",
       "bloody stumps. Another swing separated the head.\n",
       "\n",
       "The body stayed on its feet a second after the head bounced to the\n",
       "ground. When the body toppled, the battle shifted again. The fight had\n",
       "cooled, dying away. Small pockets of horsemen and bears finished off a\n",
       "few purims, but many of the creatures fled over the hills, running in\n",
       "multiple directions. They had a strange lope, three-legged so they could\n",
       "carry their weapons.\n",
       "\n",
       "The snarling faded, replaced by the moans of the wounded.\n",
       "\n",
       "Klay found Tyrus. The ranger cradled an arm. He had a gash in his mail,\n",
       "and blood streamed from his shoulder. Chobar stood to watch the purims\n",
       "flee, his tan coat covered in dark stains that made it impossible to\n",
       "count his wounds. Many of the war bears did the same, standing and\n",
       "roaring. Tyrus saw two that were too wounded to stand. Their plate\n",
       "barding was the only way to distinguish a war bear from a dead purim.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",

       "bones clicking into place, like popping knuckles, could be heard. The\n",
       "familiar burning sensation of his runes trying to fix the break made him\n",
       "sweat more. His armor was dented inward, but it did not cut off his\n",
