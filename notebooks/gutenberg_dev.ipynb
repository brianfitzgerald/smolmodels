       "One day, a trooper, like Spenser's gentle knight,'was pricking on the\n",
       "plain,' near the banks of the Goomtee. He was within a short distance\n",
       "of Chandour, a village about ten miles from Sultanpoor, the capital of\n",
       "the district, when he halted to observe a large female wolf and her\n",
       "whelps come out of a wood near the roadside, and go down to the river\n",
       "to drink. There were four whelps. Four!--surely not more than three;\n",
       "for the fourth of the juvenile company was as little like a wolf as\n",
       "possible. The horseman stared; for in fact it was a boy, going on\n",
       "all-fours like his comrades, evidently on excellent terms with them\n",
       "all, and guarded, as well as the rest, by the dam with the same\n",
       "jealous care which that exemplary mother, but unpleasant neighbour,\n",
       "bestows upon her progeny. The trooper sat still in his saddle watching\n",
       "this curious company till they had satisfied their thirst; but as soon\n",
       "as they commenced their return, he put spurs to his horse, to\n",
       "intercept the boy. Off ran the wolves, and off ran the boy\n",
       "helter-skelter--the latter keeping close up with the dam; and the\n",
       "horseman, owing to the unevenness of the ground, found it impossible\n",
       "to overtake them before they had all entered their den. He was\n",
       "determined, nevertheless, to attain his object, and assembling some\n",
       "people from the neighbouring village with pickaxes, they began to dig\n",
       "in the usual way into the hole. Having made an excavation of six or\n",
       "eight feet, the garrison evacuated the place--the wolf, the three\n",
       "whelps, and the boy, leaping suddenly out and taking to flight. The\n",
       "trooper instantly threw himself upon his horse, and set off in\n",
       "pursuit, followed by the fleetest of the party; and the ground over\n",
       "which they had to fly being this time more even, he at length headed\n",
       "the chase, and turned the whole back upon the men on foot. These\n",
       "secured the boy, and, according to prescriptive rule, allowed the wolf\n",
       "and her three whelps to go on their way.\n",
       "\n",
       "'They took the boy to the village,' says Colonel Sleeman, 'but had to\n",
       "tie him, for he was very restive, and struggled hard to rush into\n",
       "every hole or den they came near. They tried to make him speak, but\n",
       "could get nothing from him but an angry growl or snarl. He was kept\n",
       "for several days at the village, and a large crowd assembled every day\n",
       "to see him. When a grown-up person came near him, he became alarmed,\n",
       "and tried to steal away; but when a child came near him, he rushed at\n",
       "it with a fierce snarl, like that of a dog, and tried to bite it. When\n",
       "any cooked meat was put near him, he rejected it in disgust; but when\n",
       "raw meat was offered, he seized it with avidity, put it upon the\n",
       "ground, under his hands, like a dog, and ate it with evident pleasure.\n",
       "He would not let any one come near while he was eating, but he made no\n",
       "objection to a dog's coming and sharing his food with him.'\n",
       "\n",
       "This wild boy was sent to Captain Nicholetts, the European officer\n",
       "commanding the 1st regiment of Oude Local Infantry, stationed at\n",
       "Sultanpoor. He lived only three years after his capture, and died in\n",
       "August 1850. According to Captain Nicholetts' account of him, he was\n",
       "very inoffensive except when teased, and would then growl and snarl.\n",
       "He came to eat anything that was thrown to him, although much\n",
       "preferring raw flesh. He was very fond of uncooked bones, masticating\n",
       "them apparently with as much ease as meat; and he had likewise a still\n",
       "more curious partiality for small stones and earth. So great was his\n",
       "appetite, that he has been known to eat half a lamb at one meal; and\n",
       "buttermilk he would drink by the pitcher full without seeming to draw\n",
       "breath. He would never submit to wear any article of dress even in the\n",
       "coldest weather; and when a quilt stuffed with cotton was given to\n",
       "him, 'he tore it to pieces, and ate a portion of it--cotton and\n",
       "all--with his bread every day.' The countenance of the boy was\n",
       "repulsive, and his habits filthy in the extreme. He was never known to\n",
       "smile; and although fond of dogs and jackals, formed no attachment\n",
       "for any human being. Even when a favourite pariah dog, which used to\n",
       "feed with him, was shot for having fallen under suspicion of taking\n",
       "the lion's share of the meal, he appeared to be quite indifferent. He\n",
       "sometimes walked erect; but generally ran on all-fours--more\n",
       "especially to his food when it was placed at a distance from him."

       "Exhibition, in conjunction with ministerial difficulties, and the\n",
       "monster debates on the Ecclesiastical Titles' Bill, tended greatly to\n",
       "impede the ordinary business of the Houses, and gave an air of tedium\n",
       "and languor to the whole proceedings. Nevertheless, the papers for the\n",
       "year amount to no less than sixty volumes! Of these, the first six\n",
       "contain Public Bills. A bill, as most of our readers must be aware, is\n",
       "a measure submitted to the consideration of parliament with the view\n",
       "of its being adopted into the legal code of the country, for which it\n",

       "and its committees in the shape of 'private' bills, of which no record\n",
       "appears here. These are bills of special and individual application,\n",
       "such as when a public company seeks an act of incorporation, the\n",

       "course of a single and brief session; but to enter on it\n",
       "satisfactorily would require a great amount of space, and might, after\n",
       "all, be more tedious than profitable. A glance at those actually\n",
       "passed may suffice. These were 106 in number: the first is, 'An Act to\n",

       "to appoint Commissioners to inquire into the Existence of Bribery in\n",

       "includes the accounts of the Public Income and Expenditure, Public and\n",
       "National Debt, Income Tax, Public Works, and a vast variety of other\n",
       "subjects. The second volume is made up of the 'Estimates' for the\n",

       "Works, Public Salaries, Law and Justice, Education, Colonial and\n",
