If there had been anything left of him after the initial explosion, it was presumably buried beneath multiple tonnes of solid rock that now blocked the passage. A thick carpet of dust and smoke now filled the corridor, making it difficult to breath for anyone in it. With the collapse of one of the tunnels, only two opposing hallways now remained, one running off to the north, and the other one; south.\n",

Emerging out from the cloud of dust was the Blood Death Knight from earlier, his chestplate still carrying the heavy dent from Doin's axe, and the armor around his shoulder still cleaved in half from Rae'liel's own strike, yet his decomposing body was stitched together. The Death Knight clutched his Runeblade tight in his glove as he stared silently towards Liaena's group as well."
