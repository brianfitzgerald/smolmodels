       "To solve this problem, we need to maximize the sum of the power levels of the minions under Polycarp's control, given that he can only have up to `k` minions at any time. The key insight is that the order in which minions are summoned affects the final power levels because summoning a minion increases the power levels of all previously summoned minions by its `b_i` value.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Approach\n",
       "1. **Sorting Minions**: We need to determine the optimal order in which to summon the minions. One effective strategy is to sort the minions based on their `b_i` values in descending order. This way, minions that provide the largest boosts to previously summoned minions are summoned first.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Summoning and Destroying**: After sorting, we can iterate through the minions and decide whether to summon them or not. Since we can only have `k` minions at any time, we need to manage the minions carefully. If we have already summoned `k` minions, we need to destroy one before summoning a new one. The minion to destroy should be the one that contributes the least to the total power.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Tracking Power Levels**: We need to keep track of the current power levels of the minions under control. When a new minion is summoned, we update the power levels of all existing minions by adding the `b_i` value of the new minion.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Output the Sequence**: Finally, we need to output the sequence of actions (summoning and destroying) that leads to the maximum total power.\n",
