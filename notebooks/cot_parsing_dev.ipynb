       "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest cycle in a complete directed graph \\( K_n \\) that visits every directed edge exactly once. This is known as a **de Bruijn sequence** or a **universal cycle** for directed graphs.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Reasoning:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n",
       "   - In a complete directed graph \\( K_n \\), there are \\( n(n-1) \\) directed edges (since each pair of vertices \\( u \\neq v \\) has both \\( (u, v) \\) and \\( (v, u) \\)).\n",
       "   - We need to find a cycle that visits each of these edges exactly once.\n",
       "   - The cycle should be lexicographically smallest.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Lexicographical Order**:\n",
       "   - The lexicographically smallest cycle will start with the smallest vertex (vertex 1) and will prefer smaller vertices at each step.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Constructing the Cycle**:\n",
       "   - The cycle can be constructed by following a specific pattern. For example, for \\( n = 2 \\), the cycle is `1, 2, 1`.\n",
       "   - For \\( n = 3 \\), the cycle is `1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1`.\n",
       "   - The pattern can be generalized for any \\( n \\).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Efficient Construction**:\n",
       "   - Given the constraints, we need an efficient way to construct the cycle without explicitly generating the entire cycle, especially since \\( n \\) can be up to \\( 10^5 \\).\n",
       "   - We can use a mathematical approach to determine the sequence of vertices in the cycle.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Segment Extraction**:\n",
       "   - Since we only need to print a segment of the cycle, we can compute the required segment directly without generating the entire cycle.\n",

       "To solve this problem, we need to find the lexicographically smallest cycle in a complete directed graph \\( K_n \\) that visits every directed edge exactly once. This is known as a **de Bruijn sequence** or a **universal cycle** for directed graphs.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Reasoning:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Understanding the Problem**:\n",
       "   - In a complete directed graph \\( K_n \\), there are \\( n(n-1) \\) directed edges (since each pair of vertices \\( u \\neq v \\) has both \\( (u, v) \\) and \\( (v, u) \\)).\n",
       "   - We need to find a cycle that visits each of these edges exactly once.\n",
       "   - The cycle should be lexicographically smallest.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Lexicographical Order**:\n",
       "   - The lexicographically smallest cycle will start with the smallest vertex (vertex 1) and will prefer smaller vertices at each step.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Constructing the Cycle**:\n",
       "   - The cycle can be constructed by following a specific pattern. For example, for \\( n = 2 \\), the cycle is `1, 2, 1`.\n",
       "   - For \\( n = 3 \\), the cycle is `1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 1`.\n",
       "   - The pattern can be generalized for any \\( n \\).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Efficient Construction**:\n",
       "   - Given the constraints, we need an efficient way to construct the cycle without explicitly generating the entire cycle, especially since \\( n \\) can be up to \\( 10^5 \\).\n",
       "   - We can use a mathematical approach to determine the sequence of vertices in the cycle.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Segment Extraction**:\n",
       "   - Since we only need to print a segment of the cycle, we can compute the required segment directly without generating the entire cycle.\n",
