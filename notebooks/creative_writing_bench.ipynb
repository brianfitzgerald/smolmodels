The character reflects on the state of the world, their grim reality, and contemplates their possible demise, highlighting despair and a sense of futility.</a>\\n<b>The writing style is highly casual and colloquial, employing informal language and a conversational tone. Examples include phrases like \"The apocalypse sucked,\" \"It sucks balls,\" and \"Okay, imagine a big ass elephant.\"</b>\\n<c>The tone is melancholic, cynical, and darkly humorous. There\\'s a blend of despair and sarcastic acceptance of the character\\'s fate. The line \"The apocalypse sucked\" shows the cynicism and understatement of the true feeling, while the \"big ass elephant\" metaphor brings humor in the face of depressing events.</b>\\n<d>The content centers on the post-apocalyptic setting, the character\\'s drunken reflections on the state of the world, the hopelessness of their situation, and their contemplation of suicide.

The use of rhetorical questions (\"Where did the bullets go? Shouldn’t they have fallen back down?\") further emphasizes the character\\'s disorientation.</b>\\n</analysis>\\n\\n<instruction_planning>\\n<a>Style and Tone:\\nThe new paragraph should mirror the original\\'s casual and colloquial writing style, avoiding overly formal or literary language. Maintain a melancholic, cynical, and darkly humorous tone. The character\\'s voice should be pessimistic and world-weary, but with moments of sarcastic humor and self-awareness. The atmosphere must feel desolate and hopeless, but also laced with a touch of absurdity.\\n\\nb) Content and Themes:\\nThe paragraph should feature a first-person narrative from a character who is struggling to cope with a dystopian or post-apocalyptic world. The character should be intoxicated and reflecting on their grim circumstances. Include details about the setting, emphasizing its ruined and desolate nature. Explore themes of survival, loss, the search for meaning, and the character\\'s internal struggle with despair and potential self-destruction. The character should engage in some sort of risky or self-destructive behavior.\\n\\nc) Sensory Details and Imagery:\\nEmphasize sensory details to paint a vivid picture of the character\\'s environment and their physical and emotional state. Engage the senses of sight (e.g., ruined buildings, desolate landscapes), sound (e.g., distant moans, echoing noises), taste (e.g., the flavor of alcohol), smell (e.g., the stench of decay), and touch (e.g., rough surfaces, bloodstained hands). Use strong imagery to convey the character\\'s inner turmoil and the bleakness of their world.\\n\\nd) Character Interaction (if applicable):\\nAlthough not explicitly interacting with anyone living, the character should respond to the sounds and potential threats of the undead creatures below.\\n</instruction_planning>\\n\\n<instruction>\\n<style_and_tone>\\nWrite in a casual and colloquial style, similar to a personal journal entry from someone who is drunk and disillusioned. The tone should be a mix of dark humor, cynicism, and melancholy. Aim for a world-weary, pessimistic voice with moments of sarcastic levity. The overall atmosphere should feel bleak and hopeless, but punctuated with absurd or darkly comical observations. Avoid overly formal language or complex sentence structures.\\n</style_and_tone>\\n\\n<content_and_themes>\\nBegin with a statement about how terrible life is in the current dystopian setting. Introduce a first-person narrator who is intoxicated (using descriptive language about the substance they are using). The character should be situated in a ruined location, reflecting on the loss and despair surrounding them. Mention a specific event or situation that contributes to their hopelessness. Include a moment where the character contemplates a risky or self-destructive action, such as jumping off a building, engaging in a dangerous activity, or confronting a perceived threat. The main themes to explore are survival, loss, despair, and the fleeting search for meaning in a desolate world.\\n</content_and_themes>\\n\\n<structure>\\nStart with a short, blunt sentence to set the tone (e.g., \"This sucks.\"). Follow with a description of the character\\'s current state (intoxicated) and location (ruined building). Use a mix of short, declarative sentences and longer, rambling sentences to reflect the character\\'s inebriated state of mind. Include pauses, interruptions, and rhetorical questions to mimic the disorganized thoughts of a drunk person. End with the character contemplating a risky or self-destructive action. The paragraph should build towards a feeling of impending doom or a moment of reckless abandon.\\n</structure>\\n\\n<character_interaction>\\nThough no explicit interaction is required, have the character respond verbally or physically to the threats suggested by the environment, such as the undead creatures below. Make sure to make it clear that there are no survivors or help coming.\\n</character_interaction>\\n\\n<setting_description>\\nDescribe the ruined location in detail, using sensory imagery to evoke the desolation of the environment. Focus on the sights, sounds, smells, and textures of the post-apocalyptic world. Mention specific details that highlight the decay and destruction, such as crumbling buildings, overgrown vegetation, or lingering signs of past inhabitants. The setting should mirror the character\\'s internal state of despair and hopelessness.\\n</setting_description>\\n</instruction>\\n```', '<analysis>\\na) **Brief summary:** The paragraph describes a post-apocalyptic scenario where the protagonist and a companion, Wren, are ambushed by zombies while on a medical supply run, which was interrupted by their impromptu sexual encounter. The scene is action-packed and interspersed with humor and a touch of cynicism about humanity\\'s survival.\\n\\nb) **Writing style:** The writing style is casual and conversational, full of slang and coarse language. Examples include: \"doing the double-backed beast,\" \"dingle berries are clapping together like Newton’s Cradle,\" and \"shot the bastard right between the eyes.\" The style is meant to be relatable and down-to-earth, contrasting the grim setting.\\n\\nc) **Tone:** The tone is primarily humorous and sarcastic, with elements of adventure and danger. The protagonist uses humor to cope with the harsh realities of the post-apocalyptic world. Phrases like \"Was it as good for you as it was for me?\" and \"It wouldn’t have been that bad if we weren’t stark naked\" establish this tone. There is also a pragmatic acceptance of the situation and a lack of romanticism or idealism.\\n\\nd) **Content and themes:** The primary content revolves around the immediate danger of a zombie attack during a supply run. The themes include: the importance of maintaining vigilance in a post-apocalyptic world, the use of humor as a coping mechanism, the return to normal routines amidst chaos, and the potential for unexpected encounters and shifts in relationships.\\n\\ne) **Sentence structure and complexity:** The sentence structure is varied, but generally straightforward. There is a mix of short, punchy sentences for action (\"She let out a lungful of air.\") and longer sentences to describe the setting and backstory (\"The corrugated steel walls blocked off everything west of County Road 80 and Sunrise Highway.\"). The complexity comes from the colloquialisms and jargon, rather than intricate grammar.\\n\\nf) **Vocabulary level and any unique word choices:** The vocabulary is relatively low-level and accessible. However, the unique word choices and slang contribute significantly to the tone, e.g., \"double-backed beast,\" \"dingle berries,\" \"Z\\'s\" (for zombies). The author uses strong, informal language to create a sense of realism and grit.\\n\\ng) **Literary devices or techniques used:** The paragraph employs imagery (e.g., \"brain matter over its pal’s face\"), humor, and contrast. Irony is also present, as the characters engage in a frivolous activity (sex) during a dangerous mission. Foreshadowing occurs with Jess, who had been absent for 3 months.\\n</analysis>\\n\\n<instruction_planning>\\na) **Style and Tone:** The target style should be casual, conversational, and slightly irreverent. The tone should be humorous and sarcastic, with a dark edge to reflect the apocalyptic setting. Aim for a \"matter-of-fact\" narration that downplays the danger while simultaneously highlighting the absurdity of the situation. The language should include slang and slightly crude humor, but not gratuitously.\\n\\nb) **Content and Themes:** The scene should involve a dangerous but mundane task (e.g., scavenging for supplies) in a post-apocalyptic world. The characters should be engaging in something inappropriate or reckless (e.g., a casual romantic encounter) when they are suddenly ambushed. The ambush should be violent and chaotic but described with a touch of humor. Emphasize the contrast between the ordinary (attempting to maintain a routine) and the extraordinary (zombie apocalypse).\\n\\nc) **Sensory Details and Imagery:** Focus on visual and auditory details to create a vivid scene. Describe the appearance of the zombies, the sounds of the struggle (screams, gunfire), and the appearance of the surroundings (e.g., a dilapidated building, overgrown vegetation). Use strong verbs and descriptive adjectives to bring the action to life. Engage the sense of touch by describing the character\\'s physical sensations (e.g., aching muscles, the feeling of a weapon in hand).\\n\\nd) **Character Interaction:** The interaction between the protagonist and their companion should be playful and bantering, demonstrating a casual and established relationship. Dialogue should be realistic and contain witty remarks or sarcastic comments. The characters should be brave but also slightly foolish, making light of their dangerous situation.\\n</instruction_planning>\\n\\n<instruction>\\n<style_and_tone>\\nWrite in a casual, conversational style using first-person narration. The tone should be humorous and sarcastic, even flippant, despite the dangerous circumstances. Use slang and informal language liberally. Avoid overly formal descriptions or sentimental expressions. Maintain a \"matter-of-fact\" attitude, as if the protagonist is recounting an everyday event. Incorporate dark humor and irony to emphasize the absurdity of the situation.\\n</style_and_tone>\\n\\n<content_and_themes>\\nThe paragraph should depict a post-apocalyptic scenario where the protagonist and a companion are engaged in a routine task (e.g., scavenging for fuel, clearing a building, scouting a location). They should be ambushed by a mutated enemy (e.g., zombies, raiders, genetically modified creatures) while distracted by a non-essential activity (e.g., flirting, arguing, resting). The ambush should be sudden, violent, and chaotic. The characters should react with a mixture of fear, determination, and dark humor. The central themes should include the banality of evil, the struggle to maintain normalcy in a chaotic world, and the use of humor as a coping mechanism. The focus is on the present event unfolding, but with an occasional hint to their history.\\n\\n</content_and_themes>\\n\\n<structure>\\nStart with a brief description of the task the characters are undertaking. Introduce the characters and their relationship through dialogue and actions. The ambush should occur suddenly and unexpectedly, disrupting the established routine. Use short, punchy sentences to describe the action and longer sentences to provide context or internal monologue. End the paragraph with a cliffhanger or a witty observation about the situation. Vary sentence length to create a dynamic rhythm.\\n\\n</structure>\\n\\n<character_interaction>\\nThe characters should have a playful and bantering dynamic, suggesting a long-standing relationship. Their dialogue should be realistic and include witty remarks, sarcastic comments, and inside jokes. They should be capable and resourceful, but also make impulsive decisions or show moments of vulnerability. Their interactions should highlight both their competence and their flaws. Use dialogue to reveal their personalities and their shared history.\\n\\n</character_interaction>\\n\\n<setting_description>\\nBriefly describe the setting to create a sense of place. Focus on visual and auditory details that contribute to the atmosphere of decay and danger. Use strong verbs and descriptive adjectives to bring the scene to life. Mention specific landmarks or geographical features to ground the story in a believable location. Don\\'t over-describe the setting; let the action and dialogue carry the narrative.\\n</setting_description>\\n</instruction>\\n'], 'paragraph': [\"The Renegades 5\\n\\nBook Five: United\\n\\nJack Hunt\\n\\nDirect Response Publishing\\n\\nContents\\n\\nCopyright\\n\\nDedication\\n\\nSynopsis\\n\\nAlso by Jack Hunt\\n\\nEpigraph\\n\\nPrologue\\n\\nChapter 1\\n\\nChapter 2\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\nChapter 4\\n\\nChapter 5\\n\\nChapter 6\\n\\nChapter 7\\n\\nChapter 8\\n\\nChapter 9\\n\\nChapter 10\\n\\nChapter 11\\n\\nChapter 12\\n\\nChapter 13\\n\\nChapter 14\\n\\nChapter 15\\n\\nChapter 16\\n\\nChapter 17\\n\\nChapter 18\\n\\nChapter 19\\n\\nChapter 20\\n\\nChapter 21\\n\\nChapter 22\\n\\nChapter 23\\n\\nChapter 24\\n\\nChapter 25\\n\\nChapter 26\\n\\nChapter 27\\n\\nEpilogue\\n\\nAfterword\\n\\nA Plea\\n\\nNewsletter\\n\\nAbout the Author\\n\\nCopyright © 2016 by Jack Hunt\\n\\nAll rights reserved.\\n\\nNo part of this book may be reproduced in any form or by any electronic\\nor mechanical means, including information storage and retrieval\\nsystems, without written permission from the author, except for the use\\nof brief quotations in a book review.\\n\\nTHE RENEGADES 5: UNITED is a work of fiction.

It didn’t matter.\\n\\nI took another swig from the bottle and chuckled, thinking of all the\\nbloody reasons why.\\n\\nMaybe it’s because we don’t know a good thing when we have it, or\\nperhaps we have this incessant need to create drama in our lives. Who\\nknows?\\n\\nWhatever. It sucks balls. That’s all you need to know.\\n\\nI snorted, staggering around on top of what remained of some dilapidated\\nbuilding that once housed some of the finest alcohol in New York. I\\nslumped down on the gritty surface feeling small pieces of mortar press\\nagainst my skin. I adjusted the camera again and pulled back.\\n\\nYears from now you’ll watch this and…\\n\\nI frowned, wondering who would actually watch this?\\n\\nI mean, there wouldn’t be anybody, and if there was would they have\\npower?\\n\\nI shook my head in my drunken state. Where was I?\\n\\nYou’re going to wonder what it was like for us. I know I would. And\\nthough my words will fail to convey the fear or true nature of people I\\nencountered…\\n\\nAgain I lost my train of thought. The alcohol has begun to block out the\\nhorrifying memories of the past.\\n\\nThen I remember.\\n\\nSo here it is, if you don’t have a vivid imagination, let me paint you a\\npicture. Okay, imagine a big ass elephant. One of those African ones\\nwith the large ears. Got that?\\n\\nRight… I take another swig of my beer.\\n\\nOkay. Big elephant. Giant one.\\n\\nHere we go. The apocalypse…\\n\\nIt’s like getting shafted from behind by a big elephant, not that I know\\nwhat that’s like but I’m pretty damn sure it’s unpleasant. And believe\\nme, there isn’t enough K-Y Jelly in the world that could stop your ass\\nfrom being chapped by that beauty.\\n\\nThere you go.\\n\\nI didn’t say it was going to be pretty.\\n\\nThere are no two ways about it.\\n\\nIt’s painful.\\n\\nI began to feel myself becoming choked up for a few seconds before I\\nsniffed hard and tried to get a grip. I ran a bloodstained hand over my\\nweary face, widened my eyelids with the tips of my fingers and tried to\\nremember the last thought that went through my head.\\n\\nEverything was fading.\\n\\nI tilted my head back to guzzle down as much beer as humanly possible\\nwithout taking a breath. An orange and red evening sky spun above me,\\nits billowing clouds seemed almost within reach.\\n\\nScrew this.\\n\\nMy speech slurred as I nursed the bottle of beer and gazed at the camera\\ntrying to remember if this was my eighth or tenth beer? I held it up\\nagain and the final few drops landed on my tongue before I tossed it at\\nthe building across from me. It shattered and I heard the sound of them\\nover the edge.\\n\\nTheir moans, always their moans, so sick and tired of hearing the moans.\\n\\nI fired several rounds into the air to rile them up even more. Then\\nwaited.\\n\\nWhere did the bullets go? Shouldn’t they have fallen back down? I shook\\nmy head wondering if I even fired the weapon.\\n\\nI groaned as I staggered to my feet, grabbed up another bottle from a\\ncardboard box and twisted the cap off. Shuffling across the roof\\ncompletely uncoordinated, I perched myself on the ledge of the\\nthirty-foot building and gazed down. A massive crowd of undead jostled\\naround like they were in a mosh pit at a concert. Their milky eyes\\nstared up, longing for me to drop and feed their insatiable appetite.\\n\\nThank you. Thank you for coming, I declared loudly with open arms. I\\ncupped my hands around my mouth and let out a sound as though a crowd\\nwas cheering.\\n\\nThis one goes out to all the ones I’ve ever loved.\\n\\nI began to sing some garbled song that didn’t even make sense.\\n\\nThen I crouched down, took one final swig of my beer and crawled over\\nthe edge. My feet scraped against the mortar and the snarling of the Z’s\\ngot louder. Only held by my fingertips, I wondered for a second what it\\nwould be like to let go — to just end it.\\n\\nI had always thought that being chewed apart would be the worst way to\\ngo but in that moment I was unsure. Pain was pain, and I had experienced\\nmore than I cared to imagine. I wasn’t thinking straight anymore but\\nthat was the point. I didn’t want to think, feel or have to concern\\nmyself with the world that remained. It was too hard.\\n\\nI hung there just wanting to touch death’s door.\\n\\nLook, I know there will be some that might want to believe that\\neverything turned out okay. But I’m not going to cherry coat this shit,\\ndress it up or gift-wrap it in a way that is palatable, as this shit\\ndon’t slide down well.\", 'I’d like to say we all rode off into the sunset, or that a superhuman\\ngroup of Special Forces parachuted in on some rescue mission, or that\\nthe government decided to drop a nuclear bomb and wipe out entire\\ncities.\\n\\nBut that would be a lie.\\n\\nIt never happened. Why? They were too busy saving their own ass.\\n\\nOh, yeah, believe me. Just like you, I’d seen the movies, read the books\\nand worn the T-shirt that portrayed humanity rising up against the\\nasteroid heading to earth, squaring off against a volcanic eruption, or\\nsearching for answers after the earth suddenly experienced an\\nout-of-control flood, snowstorm and solar flare. And of course we all\\nwant to believe that a lone hero, smart doctor or guy with more lives\\nthan a cat would sweep in and save the day.\\n\\nBut that’s all bullshit.\\n\\nIn fact, if you believe that, let me stop you right here.\\n\\nAs what I’m about to share with you is going piss on all of that.\\n\\nCause when the world goes to hell in a handbasket, there is no one ready\\nto get their hands dirty to clean it up. Oh sure, everyone wants to\\nbelieve that the government built underground bunkers to restart\\nhumanity.\\n\\nBut to that — I say — wake up and smell the coffee!\\n\\nBunkers were created for their own personal protection, as was the\\ncommunity on Long Island that they had so eloquently named PARADISE.\\n\\nHuh! Paradise?\\n\\nNo, I’m going to tell you like it is. No Special Forces stepped in to\\nsave the day, so toss that crap out the window as that’s just macho\\nbullshit from a bunch of guys who only wished they were badass. Oh I\\nknow, some will say, but c’mon, Johnny, what about all that banging of\\nheads back in the day? You know, Semper Fi and shit?\\n\\nPlease! Give me a break.\\n\\nIf this apocalypse has made anything clear, it’s that when the shit hits\\nthe fan, action men are far from the action. In fact, they are the ones\\nusually running the other way.\\n\\nThe apocalypse reveals a person’s true colors.\\n\\nI should know, I’ve met a lot of people along the way.\\n\\nAnd I’ve done my fair share of running.\\n\\nFrom the underground silo in Castle Rock, to the streets of Salt Lake,\\nto the walled town of Fortress, and the Hive —\\xa0everyone is the same.\\n\\nIt’s a save your ass mentality and fuck all the rest.\\n\\nFor the longest time I didn’t want to believe that.\\n\\nNo, I truly thought we could make a difference.\\n\\nThat we could stand in the gap between that which came to kill and\\ndestroy.\\n\\nThat it didn’t matter how fast or strong we were.\\n\\nThat it didn’t matter if we didn’t have what it took to survive.\\n\\nBecause we had heart and that was all that mattered.\\n\\nBut I was wrong.\\n\\nWe all were.\\n\\nTears streaked my cheeks as I gave one final look at the dead waiting\\nfor me.\\n\\nI loosened my grip on the brick, one finger at a time.\\n\\nClosed my eyes.\\n\\nThen let go.\\n\\nChapter 1\\n\\nThere is always a calm before the storm.\\n\\nIt had been twelve months since we arrived in the community we called\\nParadise. In many ways life had returned to normal. As normal as could\\nbe, when beyond the erected walls still remained an infected world.\\n\\n“It’s got a hold of my leg!” Wren screamed frantically kicking the Z in\\nthe face with the other. I was holding on to her with one hand, the\\nother was reaching for a Glock against the side of my leg. Every muscle\\nin my arm was aching as I tried to maintain the grip.\\n\\n“Don’t let me go,” she cried.\\n\\n“Now why would I do that?” I smirked as my fingers finally touched the\\ngrip of my weapon. I yanked it out of the holster, wheeled it around and\\nshot the bastard right between the eyes. The slug tore apart its head\\nsending brain matter over its pal’s face. The rest of the dead clawed\\nthe air and snarled as I hauled Wren up onto the half-destroyed stone\\nstaircase.\\n\\nShe let out a lungful of air.\\n\\nWhile we were lying on our backs trying to catch our breath, I glanced\\nover.\\n\\n“Was it as good for you as it was for me?” I laughed. She slapped my\\nchest as we continued gasping for air.\\n\\nWe were on a medical supply run and became a little too frisky with each\\nother. We were in the middle of doing the double-backed beast on a\\npharmacy counter when the undead lumbered in wanting to fill a\\nprescription. It wouldn’t have been that bad if we weren’t stark naked\\nand our guns hadn’t slid off the counter onto the floor.\\n\\nIt was a juggling act between trying to get our clothes on and firing\\noff rounds, which I have to say is pretty tricky when your dingle\\nberries are clapping together like Newton’s Cradle.\\n\\n“I told you to keep your voice down,” she said as she buttoned up her\\npants with a big grin on her face. I rolled over and ran my hand up the\\nfront of her top and over her breast.\\n\\n“Same time next week?”\\n\\n“Yes, but I pick the place this time.”\\n\\nIt had become a routine, an escape from the boredom of everyday life\\ninside the walls. We could have stayed behind and let the team of\\nmilitary personnel that had recently joined do the run, but that wasn’t\\nme. The reason we had survived was because we were used to staying\\nvigilant. Life inside the walls had become so normal that it would have\\nbeen easy to lose our edge and forget that there was still danger.\\n\\n“Now how are we going to get out of here?”\\n\\n“Get Jess to swing the truck around,” she said.\\n\\nI had barely stopped to think about Jess. Today was the first time I had\\nseen her in three months. The upside, if it could be called that, was\\nthat the area of land inside the wall was so vast you could go weeks,\\neven months without seeing others. A lot had changed in twelve months.\\nThe corrugated steel walls blocked off everything west of County Road 80\\nand Sunrise Highway. Since our arrival it had been reinforced both in\\nheight and depth. An additional gate had been placed between Cedar Point\\nand Nicoll Point, which was on Shelter Island.\\n\\nThe mutated Z’s we had seen so many months ago back in the city had made\\nit in a few times because of the way they could scale walls but even\\nthey had become scarce. While they were rare to see, it had placed the\\nentire community at risk. Ethan Winthorpe and the six other leaders had\\nagreed to make the walls even taller. Since then nothing had managed to\\nget in. It also helped that a person now had to go through two more\\ngates to reach the main one. There were three gates in total positioned\\nevery fifty yards.\\n\\nThe community had grown from one thousand and twenty men, women and\\nchildren to over three thousand. Most of them came from different areas\\nof the country hoping to find safety in New York. Once every two days,\\nseveral teams would venture out into the city to try and find more\\nsurvivors. To ensure the safety of everyone, and to manage the needs of\\nthe many, Paradise had been split into seven districts; each one was\\ngoverned by one of the seven founders. From Shinnecock Hills, to the tip\\nof Montauk and on to Shelter Island, people inhabited the towns. The\\ndecision of who would go where was determined by the leadership based on\\nskill set and if you were part of a family. Shelter Island mostly\\ncatered to young families. It was the most protected and if Paradise was\\noverrun, the breakwater structure could be destroyed which in turn would\\nprevent anyone from reaching it except by water.'], 'text': [\"The Renegades 5\\n\\nBook Five: United\\n\\nJack Hunt\\n\\nDirect Response Publishing\\n\\nContents\\n\\nCopyright\\n\\nDedication\\n\\nSynopsis\\n\\nAlso by Jack Hunt\\n\\nEpigraph\\n\\nPrologue\\n\\nChapter 1\\n\\nChapter 2\\n\\nChapter 3\\n\\nChapter 4\\n\\nChapter 5\\n\\nChapter 6\\n\\nChapter 7\\n\\nChapter 8\\n\\nChapter 9\\n\\nChapter 10\\n\\nChapter 11\\n\\nChapter 12\\n\\nChapter 13\\n\\nChapter 14\\n\\nChapter 15\\n\\nChapter 16\\n\\nChapter 17\\n\\nChapter 18\\n\\nChapter 19\\n\\nChapter 20\\n\\nChapter 21\\n\\nChapter 22\\n\\nChapter 23\\n\\nChapter 24\\n\\nChapter 25\\n\\nChapter 26\\n\\nChapter 27\\n\\nEpilogue\\n\\nAfterword\\n\\nA Plea\\n\\nNewsletter\\n\\nAbout the Author\\n\\nCopyright © 2016 by Jack Hunt\\n\\nAll rights reserved.\\n\\nNo part of this book may be reproduced in any form or by any electronic\\nor mechanical means, including information storage and retrieval\\nsystems, without written permission from the author, except for the use\\nof brief quotations in a book review.\\n\\nTHE RENEGADES 5: UNITED is a work of fiction.

That’s all you need to know.\\n\\nI snorted, staggering around on top of what remained of some dilapidated\\nbuilding that once housed some of the finest alcohol in New York. I\\nslumped down on the gritty surface feeling small pieces of mortar press\\nagainst my skin. I adjusted the camera again and pulled back.\\n\\nYears from now you’ll watch this and…\\n\\nI frowned, wondering who would actually watch this?\\n\\nI mean, there wouldn’t be anybody, and if there was would they have\\npower?\\n\\nI shook my head in my drunken state. Where was I?\\n\\nYou’re going to wonder what it was like for us. I know I would. And\\nthough my words will fail to convey the fear or true nature of people I\\nencountered…\\n\\nAgain I lost my train of thought. The alcohol has begun to block out the\\nhorrifying memories of the past.\\n\\nThen I remember.\\n\\nSo here it is, if you don’t have a vivid imagination, let me paint you a\\npicture. Okay, imagine a big ass elephant. One of those African ones\\nwith the large ears. Got that?\\n\\nRight… I take another swig of my beer.\\n\\nOkay. Big elephant. Giant one.\\n\\nHere we go. The apocalypse…\\n\\nIt’s like getting shafted from behind by a big elephant, not that I know\\nwhat that’s like but I’m pretty damn sure it’s unpleasant. And believe\\nme, there isn’t enough K-Y Jelly in the world that could stop your ass\\nfrom being chapped by that beauty.\\n\\nThere you go.\\n\\nI didn’t say it was going to be pretty.\\n\\nThere are no two ways about it.\\n\\nIt’s painful.\\n\\nI began to feel myself becoming choked up for a few seconds before I\\nsniffed hard and tried to get a grip. I ran a bloodstained hand over my\\nweary face, widened my eyelids with the tips of my fingers and tried to\\nremember the last thought that went through my head.\\n\\nEverything was fading.\\n\\nI tilted my head back to guzzle down as much beer as humanly possible\\nwithout taking a breath. An orange and red evening sky spun above me,\\nits billowing clouds seemed almost within reach.\\n\\nScrew this.\\n\\nMy speech slurred as I nursed the bottle of beer and gazed at the camera\\ntrying to remember if this was my eighth or tenth beer? I held it up\\nagain and the final few drops landed on my tongue before I tossed it at\\nthe building across from me. It shattered and I heard the sound of them\\nover the edge.\\n\\nTheir moans, always their moans, so sick and tired of hearing the moans.\\n\\nI fired several rounds into the air to rile them up even more. Then\\nwaited.\\n\\nWhere did the bullets go? Shouldn’t they have fallen back down? I shook\\nmy head wondering if I even fired the weapon.\\n\\nI groaned as I staggered to my feet, grabbed up another bottle from a\\ncardboard box and twisted the cap off. Shuffling across the roof\\ncompletely uncoordinated, I perched myself on the ledge of the\\nthirty-foot building and gazed down. A massive crowd of undead jostled\\naround like they were in a mosh pit at a concert. Their milky eyes\\nstared up, longing for me to drop and feed their insatiable appetite.\\n\\nThank you. Thank you for coming, I declared loudly with open arms. I\\ncupped my hands around my mouth and let out a sound as though a crowd\\nwas cheering.\\n\\nThis one goes out to all the ones I’ve ever loved.\\n\\nI began to sing some garbled song that didn’t even make sense.\\n\\nThen I crouched down, took one final swig of my beer and crawled over\\nthe edge. My feet scraped against the mortar and the snarling of the Z’s\\ngot louder. Only held by my fingertips, I wondered for a second what it\\nwould be like to let go — to just end it.\\n\\nI had always thought that being chewed apart would be the worst way to\\ngo but in that moment I was unsure. Pain was pain, and I had experienced\\nmore than I cared to imagine. I wasn’t thinking straight anymore but\\nthat was the point. I didn’t want to think, feel or have to concern\\nmyself with the world that remained. It was too hard.\\n\\nI hung there just wanting to touch death’s door.\\n\\nLook, I know there will be some that might want to believe that\\neverything turned out okay. But I’m not going to cherry coat this shit,\\ndress it up or gift-wrap it in a way that is palatable, as this shit\\ndon’t slide down well.\", 'I’d like to say we all rode off into the sunset, or that a superhuman\\ngroup of Special Forces parachuted in on some rescue mission, or that\\nthe government decided to drop a nuclear bomb and wipe out entire\\ncities.\\n\\nBut that would be a lie.\\n\\nIt never happened. Why? They were too busy saving their own ass.\\n\\nOh, yeah, believe me. Just like you, I’d seen the movies, read the books\\nand worn the T-shirt that portrayed humanity rising up against the\\nasteroid heading to earth, squaring off against a volcanic eruption, or\\nsearching for answers after the earth suddenly experienced an\\nout-of-control flood, snowstorm and solar flare. And of course we all\\nwant to believe that a lone hero, smart doctor or guy with more lives\\nthan a cat would sweep in and save the day.\\n\\nBut that’s all bullshit.\\n\\nIn fact, if you believe that, let me stop you right here.\\n\\nAs what I’m about to share with you is going piss on all of that.\\n\\nCause when the world goes to hell in a handbasket, there is no one ready\\nto get their hands dirty to clean it up. Oh sure, everyone wants to\\nbelieve that the government built underground bunkers to restart\\nhumanity.\\n\\nBut to that — I say — wake up and smell the coffee!\\n\\nBunkers were created for their own personal protection, as was the\\ncommunity on Long Island that they had so eloquently named PARADISE.\\n\\nHuh! Paradise?\\n\\nNo, I’m going to tell you like it is. No Special Forces stepped in to\\nsave the day, so toss that crap out the window as that’s just macho\\nbullshit from a bunch of guys who only wished they were badass. Oh I\\nknow, some will say, but c’mon, Johnny, what about all that banging of\\nheads back in the day? You know, Semper Fi and shit?\\n\\nPlease! Give me a break.\\n\\nIf this apocalypse has made anything clear, it’s that when the shit hits\\nthe fan, action men are far from the action. In fact, they are the ones\\nusually running the other way.\\n\\nThe apocalypse reveals a person’s true colors.\\n\\nI should know, I’ve met a lot of people along the way.\\n\\nAnd I’ve done my fair share of running.\\n\\nFrom the underground silo in Castle Rock, to the streets of Salt Lake,\\nto the walled town of Fortress, and the Hive —\\xa0everyone is the same.\\n\\nIt’s a save your ass mentality and fuck all the rest.\\n\\nFor the longest time I didn’t want to believe that.\\n\\nNo, I truly thought we could make a difference.\\n\\nThat we could stand in the gap between that which came to kill and\\ndestroy.\\n\\nThat it didn’t matter how fast or strong we were.\\n\\nThat it didn’t matter if we didn’t have what it took to survive.\\n\\nBecause we had heart and that was all that mattered.\\n\\nBut I was wrong.\\n\\nWe all were.\\n\\nTears streaked my cheeks as I gave one final look at the dead waiting\\nfor me.\\n\\nI loosened my grip on the brick, one finger at a time.\\n\\nClosed my eyes.\\n\\nThen let go.\\n\\nChapter 1\\n\\nThere is always a calm before the storm.\\n\\nIt had been twelve months since we arrived in the community we called\\nParadise. In many ways life had returned to normal. As normal as could\\nbe, when beyond the erected walls still remained an infected world.\\n\\n“It’s got a hold of my leg!” Wren screamed frantically kicking the Z in\\nthe face with the other. I was holding on to her with one hand, the\\nother was reaching for a Glock against the side of my leg. Every muscle\\nin my arm was aching as I tried to maintain the grip.\\n\\n“Don’t let me go,” she cried.\\n\\n“Now why would I do that?” I smirked as my fingers finally touched the\\ngrip of my weapon. I yanked it out of the holster, wheeled it around and\\nshot the bastard right between the eyes. The slug tore apart its head\\nsending brain matter over its pal’s face. The rest of the dead clawed\\nthe air and snarled as I hauled Wren up onto the half-destroyed stone\\nstaircase.\\n\\nShe let out a lungful of air.\\n\\nWhile we were lying on our backs trying to catch our breath, I glanced\\nover.\\n\\n“Was it as good for you as it was for me?” I laughed. She slapped my\\nchest as we continued gasping for air.\\n\\nWe were on a medical supply run and became a little too frisky with each\\nother. We were in the middle of doing the double-backed beast on a\\npharmacy counter when the undead lumbered in wanting to fill a\\nprescription. It wouldn’t have been that bad if we weren’t stark naked\\nand our guns hadn’t slid off the counter onto the floor.\\n\\nIt was a juggling act between trying to get our clothes on and firing\\noff rounds, which I have to say is pretty tricky when your dingle\\nberries are clapping together like Newton’s Cradle.\\n\\n“I told you to keep your voice down,” she said as she buttoned up her\\npants with a big grin on her face. I rolled over and ran my hand up the\\nfront of her top and over her breast.\\n\\n“Same time next week?”\\n\\n“Yes, but I pick the place this time.”\\n\\nIt had become a routine, an escape from the boredom of everyday life\\ninside the walls. We could have stayed behind and let the team of\\nmilitary personnel that had recently joined do the run, but that wasn’t\\nme. The reason we had survived was because we were used to staying\\nvigilant. Life inside the walls had become so normal that it would have\\nbeen easy to lose our edge and forget that there was still danger.\\n\\n“Now how are we going to get out of here?”\\n\\n“Get Jess to swing the truck around,” she said.\\n\\nI had barely stopped to think about Jess. Today was the first time I had\\nseen her in three months. The upside, if it could be called that, was\\nthat the area of land inside the wall was so vast you could go weeks,\\neven months without seeing others. A lot had changed in twelve months.\\nThe corrugated steel walls blocked off everything west of County Road 80\\nand Sunrise Highway. Since our arrival it had been reinforced both in\\nheight and depth. An additional gate had been placed between Cedar Point\\nand Nicoll Point, which was on Shelter Island.\\n\\nThe mutated Z’s we had seen so many months ago back in the city had made\\nit in a few times because of the way they could scale walls but even\\nthey had become scarce. While they were rare to see, it had placed the\\nentire community at risk. Ethan Winthorpe and the six other leaders had\\nagreed to make the walls even taller. Since then nothing had managed to\\nget in. It also helped that a person now had to go through two more\\ngates to reach the main one. There were three gates in total positioned\\nevery fifty yards.\\n\\nThe community had grown from one thousand and twenty men, women and\\nchildren to over three thousand. Most of them came from different areas\\nof the country hoping to find safety in New York. Once every two days,\\nseveral teams would venture out into the city to try and find more\\nsurvivors. To ensure the safety of everyone, and to manage the needs of\\nthe many, Paradise had been split into seven districts; each one was\\ngoverned by one of the seven founders. From Shinnecock Hills, to the tip\\nof Montauk and on to Shelter Island, people inhabited the towns. The\\ndecision of who would go where was determined by the leadership based on\\nskill set and if you were part of a family. Shelter Island mostly\\ncatered to young families. It was the most protected and if Paradise was\\noverrun, the breakwater structure could be destroyed which in turn would\\nprevent anyone from reaching it except by water.'], 'title': ['the-renegades-5-united-jack-hunt(ThoseBooks).Epub', 'the-renegades-5-united-jack-hunt(ThoseBooks).Epub'], 'author': ['', ''], 'id': ['', ''], 'tags': [{'character_interaction': 'Though no explicit interaction is required, have the character respond verbally or physically to the threats suggested by the environment, such as the undead creatures below.

Now? It’s just a graveyard of forgotten dreams and broken glass. I’m three shots deep into a bottle of something that might’ve been whiskey once—now it’s more like liquid regret mixed with a hint of despair. It burns going down, but at this point, I’m just grateful for the warmth. Because warmth is a rare commodity in this godforsaken wasteland. \n",

Fear is just another flavor of despair, and I’ve had my fill. I think about jumping. I mean, what’s the worst that could happen? I could land on my feet and walk away from this mess, or maybe I’d just become another part of the scenery—a new addition to the collection of broken souls littering this hellscape. \n",
