## Coherent

### Detailed Criteria
- **Logical flow**: Ideas connect smoothly; each sentence follows naturally from the last.  
- **Clear structure**: Paragraphs have a single focus; transitions guide the reader.  
- **No leaps in logic**: Arguments don’t skip steps or assume unstated premises.  

### Good Example
> “Mia packed her bag carefully. She zipped it closed, checked her phone for the bus schedule, and locked the door behind her.”

### Bad Example
> “Mia locked the door. The bus was late. She packed a snack for school.”

## Believable Character Actions

### Detailed Criteria
- **Motivation alignment**: Actions reflect the character’s goals, past experiences, and personality.  
- **Emotional consistency**: Behavior matches stated feelings.  
- **Realistic reactions**: Responses to events feel proportional and plausible.  

### Good Example
> “After her apology fell flat, Jenna’s hands trembled. She avoided his gaze and fiddled with the coffee cup—exactly what she’d done the last time she’d disappointed him.”

### Bad Example
> “Jenna apologized, then immediately laughed and cracked a joke about it, despite saying moments ago she felt devastated.”

## Consistent Voice/Tone of Writing

### Detailed Criteria
- **Uniform vocabulary level**: Word choice stays at a similar register (formal vs. colloquial).  
- **Stable narrative distance**: Maintains either close-with-character or distant omniscient consistently.  
- **Tone alignment**: Humorous, serious, or ironic tone doesn’t flip unexpectedly.  

### Good Example
> A cozy mystery remains warm and gently witty from first page to last, never slipping into dark horror or slapstick.

### Bad Example
> A formal academic essay suddenly uses street slang in the middle of a paragraph.

## Adherence to Instructions

### Detailed Criteria
- **Completeness**: All parts of the prompt or brief are addressed.  
- **Accuracy**: Follows specified format, word count, genre, or viewpoint.

### Good Example
> **Prompt:** “Write a 150‑word persuasive email asking a boss for remote work.”  
> **Response:** A 150‑word email with greeting, clear ask, rationale, and polite close.

### Bad Example
> The email is 300 words long, goes off on personal anecdotes unrelated to remote work, and omits a closing salutation.

### Bad Example
> “She was very sad when she read the letter and cried a lot.”
